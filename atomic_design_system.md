Guide to atomic design system & components

# 1. The basic terms
Atomic design system is a design methodology first coined by Brad Frost that's inspiread by chemistry. It described a simple model for constructing interfaces made of smaller elements that fit together and form bigger blocks and larger components to create complete and polished designs. Here's the breakdown:

`Atoms ➔ Molecules ➔ Organisms ➔ Templates ➔ Pages`

What does it mean in practice?

# 2. Atoms
Atoms are the smallest interface elements that can't be broken down any further. These are buttons, sliders, toggles, chevrons, marks, etc. Atoms are the building blocks of all the atomic design elements. All changes made to atoms cascade down to molecules, organisms, pages, and so on.

# 3. Molecules
Molecules are a collection of atoms bonded together. They are built using the most basic elements and build bigger components like input fields, list items, simple cards, menu items, etc.

4. Organisms
Organisms are more complex interface elements that are consisting of bigger groups of atoms and molecules. They are usually contact forms, charts, more complex cards, calendars, tab bars, headers, menus, etc.

5. Templates/Pages
Templates focus on the page's content structure rather than the page's final content. They are like low fidelity wireframes. Pages however, are specific templates that show what a Ul looks like with real and finalised content put in place.
