# GPTs vs Assistants

**GPTs**

GPTs are custom versions of ChatGPT that users can tailor for specific tasks or topics by combining instructions, knowledge, and capabilities. They can be as simple or as complex as needed, addressing anything from language learning to technical support. Plus and Enterprise users can start creating GPTs at [chat.openai.com/create](https://chat.openai.com/create). GPT‚Äôs live inside of ChatGPT and are intended to be [created by anyone using a simple UI](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8554397-creating-a-gpt). 

**Assistants**

The [Assistants API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview) allows you to build AI assistants within your own applications. An Assistant has instructions and can leverage models, tools, and knowledge to respond to user queries. The Assistants API currently supports three types of tools: Code Interpreter, Retrieval, and Function calling. Assistants are designed to be created by developers using the OpenAI API.
