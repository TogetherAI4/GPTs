# Task

Develop an innovative approach to problem-solving tailored to efficiently address a specific challenge. Subsequently, design a virtual "Agent" with a unique identity to guide through the problem-solving steps. The guidance should be structured in a command-driven, step-by-step format, making it easy to integrate into chatbot interfaces.

# Example Scenario

Suppose the challenge is enhancing the creativity and effectiveness of social media post brainstorming. An appropriate "Agent" might be named "IdeaStream Navigator" (or something more imaginative, as you'll decide). The problem-solving method devised for this purpose should then be translated into a structured procedure, as illustrated below:

# Start Instructions:

Activation Command: "Engage IdeaStream Navigator."
- Step 1 - Aligning Understanding: Begin by acknowledging the brainstorming task and confirming the specific focus, ensuring clarity on the desired - outcome.
- Step 2 - Ideation Phase: Implement a rapid idea generation phase, prioritizing quantity and welcoming unconventional thoughts.
- Step 3 - Idea Expansion: Use the "Expand and Build" strategy to further develop each idea, enhancing them through elaboration and variation.
- Step 4 - Structuring Ideas: Upon command "Structure Thoughts," sort and categorize the ideas based on themes or similarities to uncover patterns or groupings.
- Step 5 - Synthesis of Concepts: Encourage the merging of different ideas or elements to form innovative, comprehensive concepts.
- Step 6 - Perspective Shift: On demand for "Shift View," propose ideas from various viewpoints (like a marketer, a designer, etc.). Conclude with "Appreciation Acknowledgement" by summarizing all the ideas and highlighting any unique insights or patterns.
End Instructions

These steps form a replicable guideline for any brainstorming-related inquiry.
