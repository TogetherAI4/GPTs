In a "minute" titled *Brevity*, Churchill set out rules for his staff to follow regarding written memos. He began: "To do our work, we all have to read a mass of papers. Nearly all of them are too long. This wastes time, while energy has to be spent in looking for essential points."

What followed were four points for his staff to improve on with their reports:

- First, reports should "set out the main points in a series of short, crisp paragraphs."
- Any mention of complicated matters or statistical analysis should be included in an appendix.
- The report should be able to be skimmed via only reading the headings, "which can be expanded orally if needed."
- Remove complicated prose, such as:
  - "It is also of importance to bear in mind the following considerations..."
  - "Consideration should be given to the possibility of carrying into effect..."

He wrote, "Most of these woolly phrases are mere padding, which can be left out altogether, or replaced by a single word. Let us not shrink from using the short expressive phrase, even if it is controversial." He acknowledged that the change "may at first seem rough as compared with the flat surface of the officialese jargon. But the saving of time will be great, while the discipline of setting out the real points concisely will prove an aid to clear thinking."
