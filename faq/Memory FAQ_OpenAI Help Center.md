# Memory FAQ

Learn more about managing your GPT's memory in ChatGPT.

> We are rolling out to a small portion of ChatGPT free and Plus users this week to learn how useful it is. We will share plans for broader roll out soon.

## Make responses with your chats more helpful

ChatGPT can now carry what it learns between chats, allowing it to provide more relevant responses. As you chat with ChatGPT, it will become more helpful – remembering details and preferences from your conversations. ChatGPT’s memory will get better the more you use ChatGPT and you'll start to notice the improvements over time. You can teach it to remember something new by chatting with it, for example: “Remember that I am vegetarian when you recommend a recipe.” To understand what ChatGPT remembers just ask it.
​
You’re in control of ChatGPT’s memory. You can reset it, delete specific or all memories, or turn this feature off in your settings. If you’d like to have a conversation without memory, use Temporary Chat.

### How do I enable or disable memory?

Memory is on by default. You can turn it on or off at any time by toggling the Memory setting under the Personalization section of Settings

Turning Memory off does not delete your memories, and deleting a chat doesn’t erase memories from that chat. You can delete memories conversationally or by clicking Manage.

### How do I view or delete a memory?

To understand what ChatGPT remembers you can ask it. You can also view specific memories by selecting Manage. If you’d like to delete a memory select the trash can icon next to the memory.

If Memory is on, you can also directly ask ChatGPT to forget something.
​
All memories can be deleted at once by selecting Clear ChatGPTs memory. If you delete your account, all memories are deleted.

### Does memory function with GPTs?

Memory for GPTs will be available when we roll it out more broadly.When it is, builders can enable their GPTs to have a memory. The end-user will need to have Memory on to engage with the GPT. Please note that ChatGPT and GPTs each have their own unique memories based on your interactions with them. Memory is not shared between GPTs and other GPTs or ChatGPT. Memories, like chats, with GPTs are not shared with GPT builders.

### Is memory different from Custom Instructions?

Custom Instructions continue to allow you to provide ChatGPT with direct guidance on what you’d like it to know about you and how you’d like it to respond. For explicit information or instructions, you can add it to your Custom Instructions. For information shared via conversations, ChatGPT can remember relevant details for you.  ​

### Does memory remember sensitive information?

Memory brings additional privacy and safety considerations, such as what type of information should be remembered and how it’s used. We’re taking steps to assess and mitigate biases, and steer ChatGPT away from proactively remembering sensitive information, like your health details - unless you explicitly ask it to. We are continuing to improve the model’s performance in this regard.

### How long are memories retained for?

Memories are kept separately from your chat history. This means that even if a chat is over, the memories created during that conversation can still be used in future interactions.

You can have the model forget memories at any time as explained above. If you ask the model to forget a memory, that memory should no longer be used to inform future responses or part of your viewable memory. Memories will also be deleted if you delete your account. If a memory was previously de-identified and disassociated from your account, we may still use that memory for training to improve model performance.

### Do you train your models with memories?

Memories may be used to train our models depending on your choices and plan. Learn more about your choices on how we use your content to improve model performance.
