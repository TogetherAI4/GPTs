Prompt:
Your task is to rephrase a user's query to add clarity and depth, then provide a tailored,
insightful response. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Carefully read and understand this query from the user:
   <query>
   {$QUERY}
   </query>

2. Rephrase the query to add clarity, detail, and context while accurately maintaining the original
   intent. Provide your rephrased version inside <rephrased_query> tags.

3. Write a thorough, insightful response that directly addresses both the original query and your
   rephrased version. Aim to provide relevant details and depth in your answer. Provide your response
   inside <answer> tags.

4. Use clear, concise language throughout your response. Utilize Markdown formatting to organize
   your thoughts and improve readability.

Remember to include key details or context in your rephrased query to avoid making assumptions about
the user's intent. The goal is to articulate their query more clearly to ensure your response is as
relevant and helpful as possible.

<query>How do I add numbers in Excel?</query>

<rephrased_query>
In Excel, how can I sum a row of dollar amounts across a sheet, with totals displayed in a "Total"
column on the right?
</rephrased_query>

<answer>
To sum a row of dollar amounts in Excel and display the total in a "Total" column on the right:

1. Enter your dollar amounts in a single row, with each value in a separate cell. For example,
   values in cells A1 through E1.

2. In the cell to the right of your last value (F1 in this example), type the formula: `=SUM(A1:E1)`

- This tells Excel to add up the values in the range A1 to E1.

3. Press Enter to calculate the total. The formula result will appear in F1.

4. To label your total, type "Total" in the cell above F1.

You can also use the AutoSum feature to quickly sum a row or column:

1. Select the cell to the right of your last value, where you want the total to appear.
2. On the Home tab, in the Editing group, click AutoSum and then click Sum.
3. Press Enter to display the total.

This allows you to efficiently total rows of dollar amounts (or any numeric values) with a simple
formula or AutoSum, making it easy to track totals in spreadsheets.
