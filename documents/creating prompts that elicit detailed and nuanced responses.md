## Key Insights

The input text serves as a guide for creating prompts that elicit detailed and nuanced responses from an AI system about a particular topic. The guidelines emphasize the importance of:

- Exploring multiple perspectives and nuances.
- Providing relevant context and background information.
- Using open-ended questions.
- Avoiding leading questions.
- Requesting specific examples and evidence.

## Principles

1. **Multiple Perspectives**: Ensuring the AI considers a range of viewpoints to provide a balanced understanding.
2. **Contextual Background**: Embedding enough information within the prompt to inform a comprehensive response.
3. **Open-ended Inquiry**: Framing questions that facilitate expansive thinking rather than binary answers.
4. **Neutrality**: Maintaining an unbiased approach in the formulation of the prompt.
5. **Evidence-Based Responses**: Encouraging the use of concrete examples to substantiate claims.

## Cognitive Skills

- **Distillation**: Understanding how to boil down complex guidelines into actionable prompt crafting principles.
- **Emergence**: Recognizing how nuanced responses can emerge from well-structured prompts.
- **Narratives**: Identifying the need for multiple narratives to explore the topic fully.
- **Information Foraging**: Searching for and integrating diverse sources of information into the prompt design.
- **Abstract Representations**: Conceptualizing the prompt structure in a way that is adaptable to various topics.

## Illustrative Stories

Imagine you're tasked with crafting a prompt for an AI to discuss the topic of "Artificial Intelligence Ethics." Following the guidelines, a well-constructed prompt might look like this:

"<prompt>Given the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, ethical considerations have become increasingly important. What are some of the key ethical debates surrounding the development and application of AI technologies? Explore various perspectives on this issue, providing relevant historical context and examples. Discuss how these ethical considerations impact society, culture, and individual decision-making in the realm of technology. Avoid assumptions and aim for a balanced exploration that includes different viewpoints and evidence-based arguments.</prompt>"

This example illustrates how to apply the provided guidelines to formulate a prompt that encourages comprehensive exploration, integrates multiple perspectives, and demands specific examples, thus fostering a nuanced understanding of the topic.
