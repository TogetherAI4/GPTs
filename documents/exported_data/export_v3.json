The woman on the right is wearing a bright pink dress and gold strappy heels, with long blonde hair. She is smiling as well.

The【29† best clips†twitter.com】 aren’t far off what Pixar might put out.\n\nRunway has set up an annual【30† AI film festival†aiff.runwayml.com】 that showcases【31† experimental movies】 made with a range of AI tools. This year’s festival has a $60,000 prize pot, and the 10 best films will be screened in New York and Los Angeles.\n\nIt’s no surprise that top studios are taking notice.

We’re already seeing politicians weaponizing these tools. In 【32†Argentina†www.nytimes.com】, two presidential candidates created AI-generated images and videos of their opponents to attack them. In 【33†Slovakia†www.bloomberg.com】, deepfakes of a liberal pro-European party leader threatening to raise the price of beer and making jokes about child pornography spread like wildfire during the country’s elections. And in the US, Donald Trump has 【34†cheered on†www.nytimes.com】 a group that uses AI to generate memes with racist and sexist tropes. \n\n## Related Story\n\n【35†Looking back to look forward】\n\nThis magazine's 125 years of history is fascinating—but only if we use it to help us understand where technology is headed next.\n\nWhile it’s hard to say how much these examples have influenced the outcomes of elections, their proliferation is a worrying trend. It will become harder than ever to recognize what is real online. In an already inflamed and polarized political climate, this could have severe consequences.\n\nJust a few years ago creating a deepfake would have required advanced technical skills, but generative AI has made it stupidly easy and accessible, and the outputs are looking increasingly realistic. Even reputable sources might be fooled by AI-generated content. For example, users-submitted AI-generated images purporting to depict the Israel-Gaza crisis have 【36†flooded†www.crikey.com.au】 stock image marketplaces like Adobe’s. \n\nThe coming year will be pivotal for those fighting against the proliferation of such content. Techniques to track and mitigate it content are still in early days of development. Watermarks, such as 【37†Google DeepMind’s SynthID】, are still mostly voluntary and not completely foolproof. And social media platforms are notoriously slow in taking down misinformation. Get ready for a massive real-time experiment in busting AI-generated fake news. \n\n—Melissa Heikkil ä\n\n[Image 2: robot hands flipping pancakes and holding a tube of lipstick]\n\nSTEPHANIE ARNETT/MITTR | ISTOCK, ENVATO\n\n### 4\n\n### Robots that multitask\n\nInspired by some of the core techniques behind generative AI’s current boom, roboticists are starting to build more general-purpose robots that can do a wider range of tasks.\n\nThe last few years in AI have seen a shift away from using multiple small models, each trained to do different tasks—identifying images, drawing them, captioning them—toward single, monolithic models trained to do all these things and more. By showing OpenAI’s GPT-3 a few additional examples (known as fine-tuning), researchers can train it to solve coding problems, write movie scripts, pass high school biology exams, and so on. Multimodal models, like GPT-4 and Google DeepMind’s Gemini, can solve visual tasks as well as linguistic ones.\n\nThe same approach can work for robots, so it wouldn’t be necessary to train one to flip pancakes and another to open doors: a one-size-fits-all model could give robots the ability to multitask. Several examples of work in this area emerged in 2023.\n\nIn June, DeepMind released【38† Robocat†deepmind.google】 (an update on last year’s【39† Gato】), which generates its own data from trial and error to learn how to control many different robot arms (instead of one specific arm, which is more typical). \n\nIn October, the company put out yet another general-purpose model for robots, called RT-X, and a【40† big new general-purpose training data set†deepmind.google】, in collaboration with 33 university labs. Other top research teams, such as RAIL (Robotic Artificial Intelligence and Learning) at the University of California, Berkeley, are looking at similar tech.\n\nThe problem is a lack of data. Generative AI draws on an internet-size data set of text and images. In comparison, robots have very few good sources of data to help them learn how to do many of the industrial or domestic tasks we want them to.\n\n【41†Lerrel Pinto】 at New York University leads one team addressing that. He and his colleagues are developing techniques that let robots learn by trial and error, coming up with their own training data as they go. In an even more low-key project, Pinto has recruited volunteers to collect video data from around their homes using an【42† iPhone camera mounted to a trash picker】. Big companies have also started to release large data sets for training robots in the last couple of years, such as【43† Meta’s Ego4D】.\n\nThis approach is already showing promise in driverless cars. Startups such as Wayve, Waabi, and Ghost are pioneering a【44† new wave of self-driving AI】 that uses a single large model to control a vehicle rather than multiple smaller models to control specific driving tasks. This has let small companies catch up with giants like Cruise and Waymo. Wayve is now testing its driverless cars on the narrow, busy streets of London. Robots everywhere are set to get a similar boost.\n\n—Will Douglas Heaven\n\nhide \n\n### by 【8†Melissa Heikkilä】 & 【9†Will Douglas Heaven】\n\n### Share\n\n  * 【45†linkedin link opens in a new window†www.linkedin.com】\n  * 【46†twitter link opens in a new window†twitter.com】\n  * 【",

            "text": "\n## 4. Retrieval-augmented generation\n\nAlthough generative AI tools were widely adopted in 2023, they continue to be plagued by the problem of 【54†hallucinations】: plausible-sounding but incorrect responses to users' queries. This limitation has presented a roadblock to enterprise adoption, where hallucinations in business-critical or customer-facing scenarios could be catastrophic. 【55†Retrieval-augmented generation】 (RAG) has emerged as a technique for reducing hallucinations, with potentially profound implications for enterprise AI adoption.\n\nRAG blends text generation with information retrieval to enhance the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated content. It enables LLMs to access external information, helping them produce more accurate and contextually aware responses. Bypassing the need to store all knowledge directly in the LLM also reduces model size, which increases speed and lowers costs.\n\n\"You can use RAG to go gather a ton of unstructured information, documents, etc., [and] feed it into a model without having to fine-tune or custom-train a model,\" Barrington said.\n\nThese benefits are particularly enticing for enterprise applications where up-to-date factual knowledge is crucial. For example, businesses can use RAG with 【56†foundation models】 to create more efficient and informative chatbots and virtual assistants.\n\n## 5. Customized enterprise generative AI models\n\nMassive, general-purpose tools such as Midjourney and ChatGPT have attracted the most attention among consumers exploring generative AI. But for business use cases, smaller, narrow-purpose models could prove to have the most staying power, driven by the growing demand for AI systems that can meet niche requirements.\n\nWhile creating a new model from scratch is a possibility, it's a resource-intensive proposition that will be out of reach for many organizations. To build 【57†customized generative AI】, most organizations instead modify existing AI models -- for example, tweaking their architecture or fine-tuning on a domain-specific data set. This can be cheaper than either building a new model from the ground up or relying on API calls to a public LLM.\n\n\"Calls to GPT-4 as an API, just as an example, are very expensive, both in terms of cost and in terms of latency -- how long it can actually take to return a result,\" said Shane Luke, vice president of AI and machine learning at Workday. \"We are working a lot ... on optimizing so that we have the same capability, but it's very targeted and specific. And so it can be a much smaller model that's more manageable.\"\n\nThe key advantage of customized generative AI models is their ability to cater to niche markets and user needs. Tailored generative AI tools can be built for almost any scenario, from customer support to supply chain management to document review. This is especially relevant for sectors with highly specialized terminology and practices, 【58†such as healthcare】, finance and legal.\n\nIn many business use cases, the most massive LLMs are overkill. Although ChatGPT might be the state of the art for a consumer-facing chatbot designed to handle any query, \"it's not the state of the art for smaller enterprise applications,\" Luke said.\n\nBarrington expects to see enterprises exploring a more diverse range of models in the coming year as AI developers' capabilities begin to converge. \"We're expecting, over the next year or two, for there to be a much higher degree of parity across the models -- and that's a good thing,\" he said.\n\nOn a smaller scale, Luke has seen a similar scenario play out at Workday, which provides a set of AI services for teams to experiment with internally. Although employees started out using mostly OpenAI services, Luke said, he's gradually seen a shift toward a mix of models from various providers, including Google and AWS.\n\nBuilding a customized model rather than using an off-the-shelf public tool often also improves privacy and security, as it gives organizations greater control over their data. Luke gave the example of building a model for Workday tasks that involve handling sensitive personal data, such as disability status and health history. \"Those aren't things that we're going to want to send out to a third party,\" he said. \"Our customers generally wouldn't be comfortable with that.\"\n\nIn light of these privacy and security benefits, stricter AI regulation in the coming years could push organizations to focus their energies on proprietary models, explained Gillian Crossan, risk advisory principal and global technology sector leader at Deloitte.\n\n\"It's going to encourage enterprises to focus more on private models that are proprietary, that are domain-specific, rather than focus on these large language models that are trained with data from all over the internet and everything that that brings with it,\" she said.\n\n## 6. Need for AI and machine learning talent\n\n【59†Designing, training and testing a machine learning model】 is no easy feat -- much less pushing it to production and maintaining it in a complex organizational IT environment. It's no surprise, then, that the growing need for AI and machine learning talent is 【60†expected to continue into 2024 and beyond†www.theserverside.com】.\n\n\"The market is still really hot around talent,\" Luke said. \"It's very easy to get a job in this space.\"\n\nIn particular, as AI and machine learning become more integrated into business operations, there's a growing need for professionals who can bridge the gap between theory and practice. This requires the ability to deploy, monitor and maintain AI systems in real-world settings -- a discipline often referred to as 【61†MLOps】, short for machine learning operations.\n\nIn a recent O'Reilly 【62†report†www.oreilly.com】, respondents cited AI programming, data analysis and statistics, and operations for AI and machine learning as the top three skills their organizations needed for generative AI projects. These types of skills, however, are in short supply. \"That's going to be one of the challenges around AI -- to be able to have the talent readily available,\" Crossan said.\n\nIn 2024, look for organizations to seek out talent with these types of skills -- and not just big tech companies. With IT and data nearly ubiquitous as business functions and AI initiatives rising in popularity, building internal AI and machine learning capabilities is poised to be the next stage in digital transformation.\n\nCrossan also emphasized the importance of 【63†diversity in AI initiatives】 at every level, from technical teams building models up to the board. \"One of the big issues with AI and the public models is the amount of bias that exists in the training data,\" she said. \"And unless you have that diverse team within your organization that is challenging the results and challenging what you see, you are going to potentially end up in a worse place than you were before AI.\"\n\n## 7. Shadow AI\n\nAs employees across job functions become interested in generative AI, organizations are facing the 【64†issue of shadow AI†www.computerweekly.com】: use of AI within an organization without explicit approval or oversight from the IT department. This trend is becoming increasingly prevalent as AI becomes more accessible, enabling even nontechnical workers to use it independently.\n\nShadow AI typically arises when employees need quick solutions to a problem or want to explore new technology faster than official channels allow. This is especially common for easy-to-use AI chatbots, which employees can try out in their web browsers with little difficulty -- without going through IT review and approval processes.\n\nOn the plus side, exploring ways to use these emerging technologies evinces a proactive, innovative spirit. But it also carries risk, since end users often lack relevant information on security, data privacy and compliance. For example, a user might feed trade secrets into a public-facing LLM without realizing that doing so exposes that sensitive information to third parties.\n\n\"Once something gets out into these public models, you cannot pull it back,\" Barrington said. \"So there's a bit of a fear factor and risk angle that's appropriate for most enterprises, regardless of sector, to think through.\"\n\n[Image 2: Shadow IT's negative impacts on organizations include higher costs, increased risk, interdepartmental inconsistency and lack of control by IT functions.]  Shadow AI is just one facet of the larger phenomenon of shadow IT. \n\nIn 2024, organizations will need to take steps to manage shadow AI through governance frameworks that balance supporting innovation with protecting privacy and security. This could include setting clear 【65†acceptable AI use policies】 and providing approved platforms, as well as encouraging collaboration between IT and business leaders to understand how various departments want to use AI.\n\n\"The reality is, everybody's using it,\" Barrington said, in reference to recent EY 【66†research†www.ey.com】 finding that 90% of respondents used AI at work. \"Whether you like it or not, your people are using it today, so you should figure out how to align them to ethical and responsible use of it.\"\n\n## 8. A generative AI reality check\n\nAs organizations progress from the initial excitement surrounding generative AI to actual adoption and integration, they're likely to face a reality check in 2024 -- a phase often referred to as the \"trough of disillusionment\" in the 【67†Gartner Hype Cycle】.\n\n\"We're definitely seeing a rapid shift from what we've been calling this experimentation phase into [asking], 'How do I run this at scale across my enterprise?'\" Barrington said.\n\nAs early enthusiasm begins to wane, organizations are confronting generative AI's limitations, such as output quality, security and ethics concerns, and integration difficulties with existing systems and workflows. The complexity of implementing and scaling AI in a business environment is often underestimated, and tasks such as ensuring data quality, training models and maintaining AI systems in production can be more challenging than initially anticipated.\n\n\"It's actually not very easy to build a generative AI application and put it into production",

                  "text": "\n## 4. Retrieval-augmented generation\n\nAlthough generative AI tools were widely adopted in 2023, they continue to be plagued by the problem of 【54†hallucinations】: plausible-sounding but incorrect responses to users' queries. This limitation has presented a roadblock to enterprise adoption, where hallucinations in business-critical or customer-facing scenarios could be catastrophic. 【55†Retrieval-augmented generation】 (RAG) has emerged as a technique for reducing hallucinations, with potentially profound implications for enterprise AI adoption.\n\nRAG blends text generation with information retrieval to enhance the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated content. It enables LLMs to access external information, helping them produce more accurate and contextually aware responses. Bypassing the need to store all knowledge directly in the LLM also reduces model size, which increases speed and lowers costs.\n\n\"You can use RAG to go gather a ton of unstructured information, documents, etc., [and] feed it into a model without having to fine-tune or custom-train a model,\" Barrington said.\n\nThese benefits are particularly enticing for enterprise applications where up-to-date factual knowledge is crucial. For example, businesses can use RAG with 【56†foundation models】 to create more efficient and informative chatbots and virtual assistants.\n\n## 5. Customized enterprise generative AI models\n\nMassive, general-purpose tools such as Midjourney and ChatGPT have attracted the most attention among consumers exploring generative AI. But for business use cases, smaller, narrow-purpose models could prove to have the most staying power, driven by the growing demand for AI systems that can meet niche requirements.\n\nWhile creating a new model from scratch is a possibility, it's a resource-intensive proposition that will be out of reach for many organizations. To build 【57†customized generative AI】, most organizations instead modify existing AI models -- for example, tweaking their architecture or fine-tuning on a domain-specific data set. This can be cheaper than either building a new model from the ground up or relying on API calls to a public LLM.\n\n\"Calls to GPT-4 as an API, just as an example, are very expensive, both in terms of cost and in terms of latency -- how long it can actually take to return a result,\" said Shane Luke, vice president of AI and machine learning at Workday. \"We are working a lot ... on optimizing so that we have the same capability, but it's very targeted and specific. And so it can be a much smaller model that's more manageable.\"\n\nThe key advantage of customized generative AI models is their ability to cater to niche markets and user needs. Tailored generative AI tools can be built for almost any scenario, from customer support to supply chain management to document review. This is especially relevant for sectors with highly specialized terminology and practices, 【58†such as healthcare】, finance and legal.\n\nIn many business use cases, the most massive LLMs are overkill. Although ChatGPT might be the state of the art for a consumer-facing chatbot designed to handle any query, \"it's not the state of the art for smaller enterprise applications,\" Luke said.\n\nBarrington expects to see enterprises exploring a more diverse range of models in the coming year as AI developers' capabilities begin to converge. \"We're expecting, over the next year or two, for there to be a much higher degree of parity across the models -- and that's a good thing,\" he said.\n\nOn a smaller scale, Luke has seen a similar scenario play out at Workday, which provides a set of AI services for teams to experiment with internally. Although employees started out using mostly OpenAI services, Luke said, he's gradually seen a shift toward a mix of models from various providers, including Google and AWS.\n\nBuilding a customized model rather than using an off-the-shelf public tool often also improves privacy and security, as it gives organizations greater control over their data. Luke gave the example of building a model for Workday tasks that involve handling sensitive personal data, such as disability status and health history. \"Those aren't things that we're going to want to send out to a third party,\" he said. \"Our customers generally wouldn't be comfortable with that.\"\n\nIn light of these privacy and security benefits, stricter AI regulation in the coming years could push organizations to focus their energies on proprietary models, explained Gillian Crossan, risk advisory principal and global technology sector leader at Deloitte.\n\n\"It's going to encourage enterprises to focus more on private models that are proprietary, that are domain-specific, rather than focus on these large language models that are trained with data from all over the internet and everything that that brings with it,\" she said.\n\n## 6. Need for AI and machine learning talent\n\n【59†Designing, training and testing a machine learning model】 is no easy feat -- much less pushing it to production and maintaining it in a complex organizational IT environment. It's no surprise, then, that the growing need for AI and machine learning talent is 【60†expected to continue into 2024 and beyond†www.theserverside.com】.\n\n\"The market is still really hot around talent,\" Luke said. \"It's very easy to get a job in this space.\"\n\nIn particular, as AI and machine learning become more integrated into business operations, there's a growing need for professionals who can bridge the gap between theory and practice. This requires the ability to deploy, monitor and maintain AI systems in real-world settings -- a discipline often referred to as 【61†MLOps】, short for machine learning operations.\n\nIn a recent O'Reilly 【62†report†www.oreilly.com】, respondents cited AI programming, data analysis and statistics, and operations for AI and machine learning as the top three skills their organizations needed for generative AI projects. These types of skills, however, are in short supply. \"That's going to be one of the challenges around AI -- to be able to have the talent readily available,\" Crossan said.\n\nIn 2024, look for organizations to seek out talent with these types of skills -- and not just big tech companies. With IT and data nearly ubiquitous as business functions and AI initiatives rising in popularity, building internal AI and machine learning capabilities is poised to be the next stage in digital transformation.\n\nCrossan also emphasized the importance of 【63†diversity in AI initiatives】 at every level, from technical teams building models up to the board. \"One of the big issues with AI and the public models is the amount of bias that exists in the training data,\" she said. \"And unless you have that diverse team within your organization that is challenging the results and challenging what you see, you are going to potentially end up in a worse place than you were before AI.\"\n\n## 7. Shadow AI\n\nAs employees across job functions become interested in generative AI, organizations are facing the 【64†issue of shadow AI†www.computerweekly.com】: use of AI within an organization without explicit approval or oversight from the IT department. This trend is becoming increasingly prevalent as AI becomes more accessible, enabling even nontechnical workers to use it independently.\n\nShadow AI typically arises when employees need quick solutions to a problem or want to explore new technology faster than official channels allow. This is especially common for easy-to-use AI chatbots, which employees can try out in their web browsers with little difficulty -- without going through IT review and approval processes.\n\nOn the plus side, exploring ways to use these emerging technologies evinces a proactive, innovative spirit. But it also carries risk, since end users often lack relevant information on security, data privacy and compliance. For example, a user might feed trade secrets into a public-facing LLM without realizing that doing so exposes that sensitive information to third parties.\n\n\"Once something gets out into these public models, you cannot pull it back,\" Barrington said. \"So there's a bit of a fear factor and risk angle that's appropriate for most enterprises, regardless of sector, to think through.\"\n\n[Image 2: Shadow IT's negative impacts on organizations include higher costs, increased risk, interdepartmental inconsistency and lack of control by IT functions.]  Shadow AI is just one facet of the larger phenomenon of shadow IT. \n\nIn 2024, organizations will need to take steps to manage shadow AI through governance frameworks that balance supporting innovation with protecting privacy and security. This could include setting clear 【65†acceptable AI use policies】 and providing approved platforms, as well as encouraging collaboration between IT and business leaders to understand how various departments want to use AI.\n\n\"The reality is, everybody's using it,\" Barrington said, in reference to recent EY 【66†research†www.ey.com】 finding that 90% of respondents used AI at work. \"Whether you like it or not, your people are using it today, so you should figure out how to align them to ethical and responsible use of it.\"\n\n## 8. A generative AI reality check\n\nAs organizations progress from the initial excitement surrounding generative AI to actual adoption and integration, they're likely to face a reality check in 2024 -- a phase often referred to as the \"trough of disillusionment\" in the 【67†Gartner Hype Cycle】.\n\n\"We're definitely seeing a rapid shift from what we've been calling this experimentation phase into [asking], 'How do I run this at scale across my enterprise?'\" Barrington said.\n\nAs early enthusiasm begins to wane, organizations are confronting generative AI's limitations, such as output quality, security and ethics concerns, and integration difficulties with existing systems and workflows. The complexity of implementing and scaling AI in a business environment is often underestimated, and tasks such as ensuring data quality, training models and maintaining AI systems in production can be more challenging than initially anticipated.\n\n\"It's actually not very easy to build a generative AI application and put it into production",

              "The most recent developments in AI as reported in the past week indicate a strong focus on generative AI and its applications. For instance, there is considerable advancement in the video aspect of generative AI, with startups like Runway releasing new tools every few months, significantly improving the quality of AI-generated videos. Such tools are finding uses in various sectors including the movie industry, marketing, and more, with large studios exploring AI throughout their production pipelines and leveraging the technology for things like lip-syncing in multiple languages and special effects【16†source】.\n\nFurthermore, the field is also looking at retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to address the problem of hallucinations—plausible but incorrect responses generated by AI. This technique combines text generation with information retrieval, aiming to enhance the accuracy of AI-generated content, particularly in business-critical or customer-facing scenarios【17†source】.\n\nAnother trend is the customization of enterprise AI models. Businesses are leaning towards modifying existing AI models to meet niche requirements, optimizing for cost, speed, and specificity. This shift is driven by the growing demand for AI systems that can handle highly specialized tasks, which is pertinent in sectors such as healthcare, finance, and legal【17†source】.\n\nAdditionally, the talent market for AI and machine learning continues to be vibrant, with a rising need for professionals skilled in AI programming, data analysis, statistics, and machine learning operations (MLOps). This demand is stretching beyond big tech companies into various business sectors, indicating a broadening of digital transformation efforts【17†source】.\n\nLastly, there is a growing concern about \"shadow AI\", where AI is used within organizations without the explicit approval of IT departments. This trend reflects the increasing accessibility of AI tools and poses risks related to security, data privacy, and compliance【17†source】.\n\nThese trends together sketch a picture of a rapidly advancing AI landscape, where generative AI is gaining momentum, enterprise customization is becoming crucial, talent demand is growing, and governance is becoming an important focus."

                  "text": "\nBut of course, the success of this plan hinges on whether these models work reliably. Language models often make stuff up, and generative models are 【19†riddled with biases】. They are also 【20†easy to hack】, especially if they are allowed to browse the web. Tech companies have not solved any of these problems. When the novelty wears off, they’ll have to offer their customers ways to deal with these problems. \n\n—Melissa Heikkil ä\n\n[Image 1: a film clapper with digital patter where the production info should be]\n\nSTEPHANIE ARNETT/MITTR | ENVATO\n\n### 2\n\n#### Generative AI’s second wave will be video\n\nIt’s amazing how fast the fantastic becomes familiar. The first generative models to produce photorealistic images【21† exploded into the mainstream in 2022】—and soon became commonplace. Tools like OpenAI’s DALL-E, Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion, and Adobe’s Firefly flooded the internet with jaw-dropping images of everything from the pope in Balenciaga to【22† prize-winning art†www.nytimes.com】. But it’s not all good fun: for every【23† pug waving pompoms】, there’s another piece of【24† knock-off fantasy art】 or【25† sexist sexual stereotyping】.\n\nThe new frontier is text-to-video. Expect it to take everything that was good, bad, or ugly about text-to-image and supersize it.\n\nA year ago we got the【26† first glimpse】 of what generative models could do when they were trained to stitch together multiple still images into clips a few seconds long. The results were distorted and jerky. But the tech has rapidly improved.\n\n【27†Runway】, a startup that makes generative video models (and the company that co-created Stable Diffusion), is dropping new versions of its tools every few months. Its latest model, called【28† Gen-2†research.runwayml.com】, still generates video just a few seconds long, but the quality is striking. The【29† best clips†twitter.com】 aren’t far off what Pixar might put out.\n\nRunway has set up an annual【30† AI film festival†aiff.runwayml.com】 that showcases【31† experimental movies】 made with a range of AI tools. This year’s festival has a $60,000 prize pot, and the 10 best films will be screened in New York and Los Angeles.\n\nIt’s no surprise that top studios are taking notice. Movie giants, including Paramount and Disney, are now exploring the use of generative AI throughout their production pipeline. The tech is being used to lip-sync actors’ performances to multiple foreign-language overdubs. And it is reinventing what’s possible with special effects. In 2023, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny starred a de-aged deepfake Harrison Ford. This is just the start.  \n\nAway from the big screen, deepfake tech for marketing or training purposes is taking off too. For example, UK-based Synthesia makes tools that can turn a one-off performance by an actor into an endless stream of deepfake avatars, reciting whatever script you give them at the push of a button. According to the company, its tech is now used by 44% of Fortune 100 companies. \n\nThe ability to do so much with so little 【16†raises serious questions for actors】. Concerns about studios’ use and misuse of AI were at the heart of the SAG-AFTRA strikes last year. But the true impact of the tech is only just becoming apparent. “The craft of filmmaking is fundamentally changing,” says Souki Mehdaoui, an independent filmmaker and cofounder of Bell & Whistle, a consultancy specializing in creative technologies.\n\n—Will Douglas Heaven\n\n### 3\n\n#### AI-generated election disinformation will be everywhere \n\nIf recent elections are anything to go by, AI-generated election disinformation and deepfakes are going to be a huge problem as a record number of people march to the polls in 2024. We’re already seeing politicians weaponizing these tools. In 【32†Argentina†www.nytimes.com】, two presidential candidates created AI-generated images and videos of their opponents to attack them. In 【33†Slovakia†www.bloomberg.com】, deepfakes of a liberal pro-European party leader threatening to raise the price of beer and making jokes about child pornography spread like wildfire during the country’s elections. And in the US, Donald Trump has 【34†cheered on†www.nytimes.com】 a group that uses AI to generate memes with racist and sexist tropes. \n\n## Related Story\n\n【35†Looking back to look forward】\n\nThis magazine's 125 years of history is fascinating—but only if we use it to help us understand where technology is headed next.\n\nWhile it’s hard to say how much these examples have influenced the outcomes of elections, their proliferation is a worrying trend. It will become harder than ever to recognize what is real online. In an already inflamed and polarized political climate, this could have severe consequences.\n\nJust a few years ago creating a deepfake would have required advanced technical skills, but generative AI has made it stupidly easy and accessible, and the outputs are looking increasingly realistic. Even reputable sources might be fooled by AI-generated content. For example, users-submitted AI-generated images purporting to depict the Israel-Gaza crisis have 【36†flooded†www.crikey.com.au】 stock image marketplaces like Adobe’s. \n\nThe coming year will be pivotal for those fighting against the proliferation of such content. Techniques to track and mitigate it content are still in early days of development. Watermarks, such as 【37†Google DeepMind’s SynthID】, are still mostly voluntary and not completely foolproof. And social media platforms are notoriously slow in taking down misinformation. Get ready for a massive real-time experiment in busting AI-generated fake news. \n\n—Melissa Heikkil ä\n\n[Image 2: robot hands flipping pancakes and holding a tube of lipstick]\n\nSTEPHANIE ARNETT/MITTR | ISTOCK, ENVATO\n\n### 4\n\n### Robots that multitask\n\nInspired by some of the core techniques behind generative AI’s current boom, roboticists are starting to build more general-purpose robots that can do a wider range of tasks.\n\nThe last few years in AI have seen a shift away from using multiple small models, each trained to do different tasks—identifying images, drawing them, captioning them—toward single, monolithic models trained to do all these things and more. By showing OpenAI’s GPT-3 a few additional examples (known as fine-tuning), researchers can train it to solve coding problems, write movie scripts, pass high school biology exams, and so on. Multimodal models, like GPT-4 and Google DeepMind’s Gemini, can solve visual tasks as well as linguistic ones.\n\nThe same approach can work for robots, so it wouldn’t be necessary to train one to flip pancakes and another to open doors: a one-size-fits-all model could give robots the ability to multitask. Several examples of work in this area emerged in 2023.\n\nIn June, DeepMind released【38† Robocat†deepmind.google】 (an update on last year’s【39† Gato】), which generates its own data from trial and error to learn how to control many different robot arms (instead of one specific arm, which is more typical). \n\nIn October, the company put out yet another general-purpose model for robots, called RT-X, and a【40† big new general-purpose training data set†deepmind.google】, in collaboration with 33 university labs. Other top research teams, such as RAIL (Robotic Artificial Intelligence and Learning) at the University of California, Berkeley, are looking at similar tech.\n\nThe problem is a lack of data. Generative AI draws on an internet-size data set of text and images. In comparison, robots have very few good sources of data to help them learn how to do many of the industrial or domestic tasks we want them to.\n\n【41†Lerrel Pinto】 at New York University leads one team addressing that. He and his colleagues are developing techniques that let robots learn by trial and error, coming up with their own training data as they go. In an even more low-key project, Pinto has recruited volunteers to collect video data from around their homes using an【42† iPhone camera mounted to a trash picker】. Big companies have also started to release large data sets for training robots in the last couple of years, such as【43† Meta’s Ego4D】.\n\nThis approach is already showing promise in driverless cars. Startups such as Wayve, Waabi, and Ghost are pioneering a【44† new wave of self-driving AI】 that uses a single large model to control a vehicle rather than multiple smaller models to control specific driving tasks. This has let small companies catch up with giants like Cruise and Waymo. Wayve is now testing its driverless cars on the narrow, busy streets of London. Robots everywhere are set to get a similar boost.\n\n—Will Douglas Heaven\n\nhide \n\n### by 【8†Melissa Heikkilä】 & 【9†Will Douglas Heaven】\n\n### Share\n\n  * 【45†linkedin link opens in a new window†www.linkedin.com】\n  * 【46†twitter link opens in a new window†twitter.com】\n  * 【",

These types of skills, however, are in short supply. \"That's going to be one of the challenges around AI -- to be able to have the talent readily available,\" Crossan said.\n\nIn 2024, look for organizations to seek out talent with these types of skills -- and not just big tech companies. With IT and data nearly ubiquitous as business functions and AI initiatives rising in popularity, building internal AI and machine learning capabilities is poised to be the next stage in digital transformation.\n\nCrossan also emphasized the importance of 【63†diversity in AI initiatives】 at every level, from technical teams building models up to the board. \"One of the big issues with AI and the public models is the amount of bias that exists in the training data,\" she said. \"And unless you have that diverse team within your organization that is challenging the results and challenging what you see, you are going to potentially end up in a worse place than you were before AI.\"\n\n## 7. Shadow AI\n\nAs employees across job functions become interested in generative AI, organizations are facing the 【64†issue of shadow AI†www.computerweekly.com】: use of AI within an organization without explicit approval or oversight from the IT department. This trend is becoming increasingly prevalent as AI becomes more accessible, enabling even nontechnical workers to use it independently.\n\nShadow AI typically arises when employees need quick solutions to a problem or want to explore new technology faster than official channels allow. This is especially common for easy-to-use AI chatbots, which employees can try out in their web browsers with little difficulty -- without going through IT review and approval processes.\n\nOn the plus side, exploring ways to use these emerging technologies evinces a proactive, innovative spirit. But it also carries risk, since end users often lack relevant information on security, data privacy and compliance. For example, a user might feed trade secrets into a public-facing LLM without realizing that doing so exposes that sensitive information to third parties.\n\n\"Once something gets out into these public models, you cannot pull it back,\" Barrington said. \"So there's a bit of a fear factor and risk angle that's appropriate for most enterprises, regardless of sector, to think through.\"\n\n[Image 2: Shadow IT's negative impacts on organizations include higher costs, increased risk, interdepartmental inconsistency and lack of control by IT functions.]  Shadow AI is just one facet of the larger phenomenon of shadow IT. \n\nIn 2024, organizations will need to take steps to manage shadow AI through governance frameworks that balance supporting innovation with protecting privacy and security. This could include setting clear 【65†acceptable AI use policies】 and providing approved platforms, as well as encouraging collaboration between IT and business leaders to understand how various departments want to use AI.\n\n\"The reality is, everybody's using it,\" Barrington said, in reference to recent EY 【66†research†www.ey.com】 finding that 90% of respondents used AI at work. \"Whether you like it or not, your people are using it today, so you should figure out how to align them to ethical and responsible use of it.\"\n\n## 8. A generative AI reality check\n\nAs organizations progress from the initial excitement surrounding generative AI to actual adoption and integration, they're likely to face a reality check in 2024 -- a phase often referred to as the \"trough of disillusionment\" in the 【67†Gartner Hype Cycle】.\n\n\"We're definitely seeing a rapid shift from what we've been calling this experimentation phase into [asking], 'How do I run this at scale across my enterprise?'\" Barrington said.\n\nAs early enthusiasm begins to wane, organizations are confronting generative AI's limitations, such as output quality, security and ethics concerns, and integration difficulties with existing systems and workflows. The complexity of implementing and scaling AI in a business environment is often underestimated, and tasks such as ensuring data quality, training models and maintaining AI systems in production can be more challenging than initially anticipated.\n\n\"It's actually not very easy to build a generative AI application and put it into production",

Retrieval-augmented generation\n\nAlthough generative AI tools were widely adopted in 2023, they continue to be plagued by the problem of 【54†hallucinations】: plausible-sounding but incorrect responses to users' queries. This limitation has presented a roadblock to enterprise adoption, where hallucinations in business-critical or customer-facing scenarios could be catastrophic. 【55†Retrieval-augmented generation】 (RAG) has emerged as a technique for reducing hallucinations, with potentially profound implications for enterprise AI adoption.\n\nRAG blends text generation with information retrieval to enhance the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated content. It enables LLMs to access external information, helping them produce more accurate and contextually aware responses. Bypassing the need to store all knowledge directly in the LLM also reduces model size, which increases speed and lowers costs.\n\n\"You can use RAG to go gather a ton of unstructured information, documents, etc., [and] feed it into a model without having to fine-tune or custom-train a model,\" Barrington said.\n\nThese benefits are particularly enticing for enterprise applications where up-to-date factual knowledge is crucial. For example, businesses can use RAG with 【56†foundation models】 to create more efficient and informative chatbots and virtual assistants.\n\n## 5. Customized enterprise generative AI models\n\nMassive, general-purpose tools such as Midjourney and ChatGPT have attracted the most attention among consumers exploring generative AI. But for business use cases, smaller, narrow-purpose models could prove to have the most staying power, driven by the growing demand for AI systems that can meet niche requirements.\n\nWhile creating a new model from scratch is a possibility, it's a resource-intensive proposition that will be out of reach for many organizations. To build 【57†customized generative AI】, most organizations instead modify existing AI models -- for example, tweaking their architecture or fine-tuning on a domain-specific data set. This can be cheaper than either building a new model from the ground up or relying on API calls to a public LLM.\n\n\"Calls to GPT-4 as an API, just as an example, are very expensive, both in terms of cost and in terms of latency -- how long it can actually take to return a result,\" said Shane Luke, vice president of AI and machine learning at Workday. \"We are working a lot ... on optimizing so that we have the same capability, but it's very targeted and specific. And so it can be a much smaller model that's more manageable.\"\n\nThe key advantage of customized generative AI models is their ability to cater to niche markets and user needs. Tailored generative AI tools can be built for almost any scenario, from customer support to supply chain management to document review. This is especially relevant for sectors with highly specialized terminology and practices, 【58†such as healthcare】, finance and legal.\n\nIn many business use cases, the most massive LLMs are overkill. Although ChatGPT might be the state of the art for a consumer-facing chatbot designed to handle any query, \"it's not the state of the art for smaller enterprise applications,\" Luke said.\n\nBarrington expects to see enterprises exploring a more diverse range of models in the coming year as AI developers' capabilities begin to converge. \"We're expecting, over the next year or two, for there to be a much higher degree of parity across the models -- and that's a good thing,\" he said.\n\nOn a smaller scale, Luke has seen a similar scenario play out at Workday, which provides a set of AI services for teams to experiment with internally. Although employees started out using mostly OpenAI services, Luke said, he's gradually seen a shift toward a mix of models from various providers, including Google and AWS.\n\nBuilding a customized model rather than using an off-the-shelf public tool often also improves privacy and security, as it gives organizations greater control over their data. Luke gave the example of building a model for Workday tasks that involve handling sensitive personal data, such as disability status and health history. \"Those aren't things that we're going to want to send out to a third party,\" he said. \"Our customers generally wouldn't be comfortable with that.\"\n\nIn light of these privacy and security benefits, stricter AI regulation in the coming years could push organizations to focus their energies on proprietary models, explained Gillian Crossan, risk advisory principal and global technology sector leader at Deloitte.\n\n\"It's going to encourage enterprises to focus more on private models that are proprietary, that are domain-specific, rather than focus on these large language models that are trained with data from all over the internet and everything that that brings with it,\" she said.\n\n## 6.

This requires the ability to deploy, monitor and maintain AI systems in real-world settings -- a discipline often referred to as 【61†MLOps】, short for machine learning operations.\n\nIn a recent O'Reilly 【62†report†www.oreilly.com】, respondents cited AI programming, data analysis and statistics, and operations for AI and machine learning as the top three skills their organizations needed for generative AI projects. These types of skills, however, are in short supply. \"That's going to be one of the challenges around AI -- to be able to have the talent readily available,\" Crossan said.\n\nIn 2024, look for organizations to seek out talent with these types of skills -- and not just big tech companies. With IT and data nearly ubiquitous as business functions and AI initiatives rising in popularity, building internal AI and machine learning capabilities is poised to be the next stage in digital transformation.\n\nCrossan also emphasized the importance of 【63†diversity in AI initiatives】 at every level, from technical teams building models up to the board. \"One of the big issues with AI and the public models is the amount of bias that exists in the training data,\" she said. \"And unless you have that diverse team within your organization that is challenging the results and challenging what you see, you are going to potentially end up in a worse place than you were before AI.\"\n\n## 7. Shadow AI\n\nAs employees across job functions become interested in generative AI, organizations are facing the 【64†issue of shadow AI†www.computerweekly.com】: use of AI within an organization without explicit approval or oversight from the IT department. This trend is becoming increasingly prevalent as AI becomes more accessible, enabling even nontechnical workers to use it independently.\n\nShadow AI typically arises when employees need quick solutions to a problem or want to explore new technology faster than official channels allow. This is especially common for easy-to-use AI chatbots, which employees can try out in their web browsers with little difficulty -- without going through IT review and approval processes.\n\nOn the plus side, exploring ways to use these emerging technologies evinces a proactive, innovative spirit. But it also carries risk, since end users often lack relevant information on security, data privacy and compliance. For example, a user might feed trade secrets into a public-facing LLM without realizing that doing so exposes that sensitive information to third parties.\n\n\"Once something gets out into these public models, you cannot pull it back,\" Barrington said. \"So there's a bit of a fear factor and risk angle that's appropriate for most enterprises, regardless of sector, to think through.\"\n\n[Image 2: Shadow IT's negative impacts on organizations include higher costs, increased risk, interdepartmental inconsistency and lack of control by IT functions.]  Shadow AI is just one facet of the larger phenomenon of shadow IT. \n\nIn 2024, organizations will need to take steps to manage shadow AI through governance frameworks that balance supporting innovation with protecting privacy and security. This could include setting clear 【65†acceptable AI use policies】 and providing approved platforms, as well as encouraging collaboration between IT and business leaders to understand how various departments want to use AI.\n\n\"The reality is, everybody's using it,\" Barrington said, in reference to recent EY 【66†research†www.ey.com】 finding that 90% of respondents used AI at work. \"Whether you like it or not, your people are using it today, so you should figure out how to align them to ethical and responsible use of it.\"\n\n## 8. A generative AI reality check\n\nAs organizations progress from the initial excitement surrounding generative AI to actual adoption and integration, they're likely to face a reality check in 2024 -- a phase often referred to as the \"trough of disillusionment\" in the 【67†Gartner Hype Cycle】.\n\n\"We're definitely seeing a rapid shift from what we've been calling this experimentation phase into [asking], 'How do I run this at scale across my enterprise?'\" Barrington said.\n\nAs early enthusiasm begins to wane, organizations are confronting generative AI's limitations, such as output quality, security and ethics concerns, and integration difficulties with existing systems and workflows. The complexity of implementing and scaling AI in a business environment is often underestimated, and tasks such as ensuring data quality, training models and maintaining AI systems in production can be more challenging than initially anticipated.\n\n\"It's actually not very easy to build a generative AI application and put it into production",
