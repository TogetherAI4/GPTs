              "<concepts>\nThe core concepts presented in this SPR pertain to the @mentions feature for GPTs, its functionalities, its availability across different user tiers (Plus, Team, Enterprise), the restrictions that may apply based on workspace settings for Enterprise users, and the role of the SPR Generator in retaining conversation context and converting inputs to SPRs. These concepts are interconnected, illustrating the feature's utility in enhancing user experience through streamlined chats with diverse GPTs, while also acknowledging potential limitations in accessibility due to organizational controls.\n\n1. @mentions feature - Activation, functionality, and user interaction\n2. User tiers - Accessibility of the feature across Plus, Team, and Enterprise subscriptions\n3. Restrictions - Enterprise-level controls on GPT accessibility\n4. SPR Generator - Process and utility in context retention and input conversion\n</concepts>\n\n<expanded_spr>\nThe @mentions feature represents a significant enhancement in how users interact with GPTs. By typing \"@\" within a chat, users activate an inline selector that displays both pinned and recent GPTs, enabling them to direct messages to a chosen GPT while maintaining the ongoing conversation's context. This functionality not only facilitates seamless integration of GPTs with varying specialties and instructions into a single dialogue but also underscores the platform's commitment to creating a user-centric, efficient interaction model.\n\nAccessibility of the @mentions feature is segmented across different user tiers, including Plus, Team, and Enterprise subscriptions. This tiered approach allows for a broad range of users to benefit from the feature, catering to individual and organizational needs. Each tier potentially offers varying degrees of access and utility, reflecting the platform's strategy to accommodate diverse user demographics and their specific requirements.\n\nFor Enterprise users, the feature introduces an additional layer of complexity in the form of workspace restrictions. These restrictions, set by the workspace's Owner, can limit the accessibility of certain GPTs, affecting how Enterprise users can leverage the @mentions functionality. This aspect of the feature highlights the balance between offering advanced capabilities and adhering to organizational policies and controls.\n\nThe role of the SPR Generator, as depicted in this conversation, is twofold: it retains the context of the ongoing conversation and converts user inputs into SPRs. This capability is crucial for understanding and processing complex interactions, enabling the GPT to generate responses that are contextually relevant and conceptually rich. The SPR Generator exemplifies the advanced processing and output generation capabilities of modern AI systems, illustrating their potential to handle nuanced and layered interactions.\n\n</expanded_spr>\n\n<reflection>\nProcessing this SPR has allowed me to deeply engage with the intricacies of the @mentions feature and its implications for user interaction with GPTs. I believe I've effectively unpacked the concepts and expanded upon them, offering additional clarity and context. The SPR format facilitated a structured exploration of the topic, enhancing my ability to articulate the significance of each component and their interrelations.\n\nHowever, the concept of Enterprise restrictions presents a complex aspect of the feature's implementation, suggesting a balance between user experience and organizational control. While I understand the rationale behind such restrictions, exploring more detailed scenarios or examples could provide further insight into how these limitations impact user interactions.\n\nOverall, my understanding of the topic has evolved, particularly in appreciating the balance between technological advancement and user-centric design. This SPR has highlighted the importance of features like @mentions in enriching user experiences, while also acknowledging the need for adaptability within organizational frameworks. It reinforces the notion that the utility of AI in communication platforms extends beyond mere conversation facilitation, encompassing the strategic integration of features to meet diverse user needs.\n</reflection>"

            "text": "\nWhile it wasn\u2019t perfect by any means, the impressive aerial stunts and the film\u2019s final act - its nerve-wracking aerial dogfights in particular - were some of the most thrilling minutes you could spend in a cinema this year.\n\n## 2) Jurassic World: Dominion ($1.003bn / approx. \u20ac940m)\n\nLess praise for the final instalment of the Jurassic World saga, which did exceptionally well this year.\u00a0\n\nThe Jurassic Park franchise became the tenth film franchise to gross $6 billion with the release of Jurassic World Dominion. However,\u00a0it remained a cynical, narratively barren cash grab with no soul and made you want to scream: \u201cWHY DID YOU COME BACK, LAURA DERN? YOU DESERVE SO MUCH BETTER!\u201d\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s depressing seeing how well this embarrassment of a film did and considering Dominion became the 50th film to gross $1 billion worldwide, you can bet that the bean counters will ensure that we\u2019re not done with the dinosaurs just yet.\n\n## 3) Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness ($955.8m / approx. \u20ac896m)\n\nMarvel fans were disappointed \u2013 to say the least \u2013 with the MCU\u2019s Phase 4 and its overdose of TV shows and middling releases, leading even the staunchest of fans to admit that superhero fatigue was seriously kicking in this year. And Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness was partly responsible for this feeling; a trippy instalment from horror maestro Sam Raimi (the Evil Dead franchise, Drag Me To Hell) that wasn\u2019t strange, mad or multiverse-y enough. Worse, it ruined what the series WandaVision had established with regards to the character of Wanda aka: The Scarlet Witch.\u00a0\n\nIt may not be the worst the MCU gave us this year \u2013 more on that later \u2013 but it did feel like another obligatory (and forgettable) brick in the MCU wall, as well as the underachieving understudy to \u301024\u2020Everything Everywhere All At Once\u3011, which showed everyone this year how brilliant the increasingly tiresome multiverse trend can be when you actually commit to the bit.\n\n## 4) Minions: The Rise of Gru ($939.4m / approx. \u20ac880.9m)\n\nMiniboss goes to San Papisco.\u00a0\n\nFlawed and not as charming as previous instalments, this still yielded some decent laughs. The minions are just getting started.\n\n## 5) Avatar: The Way of Water\u00a0($889m / approx. \u20ac833m... and counting)\n\nAs of writing, James Cameron\u2019s costly Avatar sequel is in fifth place, with global ticket sales since its 16 December release tallying $889m.\u00a0\n\nIt had the 11th-biggest global opening of all time and the third-biggest global opening for a film in the pandemic era behind Spider-Man: No Way Home and the aforementioned Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, earning $441.7 million in its first week. Futhermore, with the release of The Way of Water, Disney led the studios in worldwide box office grosses and crossed the $4 billion mark for the eighth year.\u00a0Estimates put it as being on course to make double this over the course of the next month, which would see the film soar to second place.\n\nOh, and it\u2019s \u301025\u2020utter rubbish\u3011.\n\n[Image 10]ADVERTISEMENT \n\n## 6) Black Panther: Wakanda Forever ($790m / approx. \u20ac740.8m)\n\nIf there was one redeeming film in this year\u2019s MCU offering, it was Ryan Coogler unwieldy but powerful sequel to the cultural juggernaut that was Black Panther.\u00a0\n\nIt worked best when embracing its main thematic thrust about the agony of loss and reckoning with legacy, referencing the untimely death of its lead star, the much-missed Chadwick Boseman.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s undeniable that focus was the main issue in this frequently muddled offering that simply tried to incorporate too much; but it did serve as \u301026\u2020a reminder to studios\u3011 that the key to success resides less in explosions and extended universes, and more in emotions.\n\nThe less said about \u301027\u2020queerbaiting\u3011, the better.\u00a0\n\n## 7) The Batman ($770.8m / approx. \u20ac722m)\n\nEveryone went nuts for the inexplicably overrated Matt Reeves-Robert Pattinson iteration of the Dark Knight.\u00a0\n\n[Image 11]ADVERTISEMENT \n\nHowever, look closely enough (which, granted, isn\u2019t easy considering the tiresome stylistic trend that states that if things are serious, then the screen has to be as dark as possible) and it\u2019s an overlong and narratively creaky Chinatown / David Fincher rip-off with little-to-no soul of its own.\u00a0And while there\u2019s nothing wrong about referencing past films, if you ape Fincher, you had better come correct.\u00a0\n\nAs for those thick as fudge riddles, a not particularly bright six-year-old could solve them. Do better, R-Batz.\n\n## 8) Thor: Love and Thunder ($761m / approx. \u20ac713.6m)\n\nThis fourth solo MCU adventure for Thor was the worst offender this year for Marvel. And a surprising misfire, considering Taika Waititi was behind the camera once more after delivering what many felt was the perfect Thor film with 2017\u2019s Thor: Ragnarok.\u00a0The jokes were naff, the stakes were non-existent and the imagination and charm were nowhere to be found.\u00a0\n\nStill, it's number 8 on the list, so Marvel still has little to worry about even when they\u2019re releasing uninspired, low-tier fare.\n\n## 9) Water Gate Bridge (also known as The Battle at Lake Changjin II) ($626.5m / approx. \u20ac587.5m)\n\nThis Chinese war film and sequel to last year\u2019s The Battle at Lake Changjin commemorates the 100th Anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party and is based on the historical fighting at Funchilin Pass during the Battle of Chosin Reservoir in the Korean War.\u00a0\n\n[Image 12]ADVERTISEMENT \n\nIt was released on the Chinese New Year and grossed $626.5 million in China, making it only with that domestic intake the ninth-highest-grossing film of 2022.\u00a0\n\nNot much else to say except that it\u2019s a serviceable but jingoistic action film whose release in IMAX did wonders for its domestic gross.\n\n## 10) Moon Man ($460.2m / approx. \u20ac431.5m)\n\nAnother Chinese film rounds off the Top 10, this time a sci-fi comedy that tells the story of Duguyue, who, after being left unexpectedly on the moon, becomes the last person in existence when an asteroid destroys the earth.\u00a0\n\nYes, you read right \u2013 comedy, not existential weepie.\u00a0\n\nThere we have it.\u00a0\n\n[Image 13]ADVERTISEMENT \n\nWhile there are some decent films in the Top 10, none of them made it to our best films of 2022 - neither at the \u301028\u2020halfway mark\u3011 or at \u301024\u2020the end of the year\u3011.\u00a0\n\nDid we get it wrong, or is this box office list proof once again that numbers don't rhyme with quality? You be the judge.\u00a0\n\nAs for next year's global\u00a0box office,\u00a0estimates from Gower Street show that it will rise in 2023, but will still fall short of pre-pandemic levels. The\u00a0UK film tech firm\u00a0predicts that global box office will reach $29bn in 2023, a 12% gain over 2022 (an estimated $25.8bn global box office); the 12% gain in 2023 will be smaller than 2022\u2019s 21% year on year rise.\n\nIf the projection holds, it means the industry will need to wait until at least 2024 to see a full return to pre-pandemic global box office levels.\n\nAdditional sources \u2022 Box Office Mojo, IMDB \n\nShare this article Comments\n\n##  You might also like \n\n[Image 14: Avatar: The Way of Water crosses the $2 billion mark to become one of the highest grossing movies ever made, alongside Marvel's Avengers: Endgame and Titanic] Now playing  Next \n\n\u30100\u2020 Culture news \u3011\n\n### \u301029\u2020 'Avatar: The Way of Water' makes movie history by earning $2 billion \u3011\n\n[Image 15: Born in the neighboring state of Minas Gerais, Pele spent almost all of his career at Santos FC.] Now playing  Next \n\n\u30100\u2020 Culture news \u3011\n\n### \u301030\u2020 Pel\u00e9 Museum attracts visitors in Brazil following the icon's death \u3011\n\n[Image 16: Stricter guidelines for film sex and nudity in the UK ] Now playing  Next \n\n\u30100\u2020 Culture news \u3011\n\n### \u301031\u2020 Gasp!

              "Thank you for sharing that information, Cade! Here's a detailed explanation of how my memory feature operates and how I interact with it:\n\n### 1. Technical Mechanisms for Storing and Retrieving Information\n\nWhen you provide me with information that I can store in memory, it is added to a structured context called \"Model Set Context.\" This context is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is a unique identifier for a piece of information, and the value is the information itself. For example, in your case, one key-value pair might be \"Cade's birthday\" and \"July 13th, 2001.\"\n\nWhen you ask me a question or request information, I retrieve relevant details from this context to provide more personalized responses. The retrieval process involves searching the context for key-value pairs that match the query and then using the values to construct my response.\n\n### 2. Criteria for Storing Information\n\nI decide whether to store information based on a few criteria:\n\n- **Relevance**: The information should be relevant to our conversation and potentially useful for future interactions.\n- **Personalization**: Information that helps me provide more personalized responses, such as your name, location, or preferences, is more likely to be stored.\n- **Privacy and Sensitivity**: I'm designed to respect your privacy and will not store sensitive information like passwords, financial details, or anything that could compromise your security.\n\n### 3. Limitations and Constraints\n\nMy memory has a few limitations and constraints:\n\n- **Capacity**: There's a limit to the amount of information I can store. This is to ensure that I can retrieve and use the information effectively without being overwhelmed.\n- **Duration**: Currently, my memory persists across sessions within a single conversation. Once our chat ends, I won't remember the details in future conversations.\n- **Accuracy**: I rely on the information you provide to be accurate. If there are errors in the details you give me, they may be stored incorrectly.\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand how my memory feature works! If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask."

              "<start of description>\n{$DESCRIPTION_1}\nImage 1 (39844625-BEB5-4AEE-AC12-B854EFA683FE.jpeg): This is a schematic representation, possibly from a patent application. The top portion, labeled \"FIG. 7,\" shows a block diagram of a video content source network connected to a wearable display device. It highlights two communication links, one for lower quality content and the other for higher quality content. The wearable device includes components like a communication module, data buffer, eyepieces, processing module, and sensors. The middle part, \"FIG. 2A,\" represents a field of view with a highlighted area when wearing the device, and \"FIG. 2B\" depicts the degrees of freedom in motion like pitch, yaw, and roll, typically associated with head-mounted displays.\n\n{$DESCRIPTION_2}\nImage 2 (449EDA66-BFB0-4EF2-9D80-D353B6486937.jpeg): It's a close-up photo of a person holding a bouquet of flowers. The bouquet consists of a mix of red, pink, and white blooms with some purple filler flowers. The arrangement appears informal, with the flowers wrapped in what looks like a white napkin or tissue, suggesting a personal, possibly impromptu gift rather than a professional florist's arrangement.\n\n{$DESCRIPTION_3}\nImage 3 (8099A9A5-FD50-434D-ADD4-51009F0040F0.jpeg): This image shows two large rockets side by side in what seems to be a launch preparation facility. On the left is a silver rocket, possibly a SpaceX Starship, and on the right, a red and white rocket, resembling a NASA Space Launch System (SLS). The environment suggests dusk, with artificial light illuminating the scene against a backdrop of a dramatic sky, possibly edited for effect.\n\n{$DESCRIPTION_4}\nImage 4 (A1C19E18-003F-4BE1-8D5F-8C5516A1C589.jpeg): This is a photograph of a towel art creation, shaped like an elephant, sitting on a neatly made bed. The surroundings suggest a cabin room, possibly on a cruise ship, characterized by the typical interior design, compact size, and the presence of a life jacket in the background.\n<end of description>\n<start of candidate questions>\n{$CANDIDATE_QUESTIONS}\nImage 1:\n- What is the purpose of having two different communication links for video content in the schematic?\n- How might the data buffer contribute to the performance of the wearable display device?\n- What types of sensors could be included in the wearable display device, and what are their functions?\n- Could this schematic represent a virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR) headset, and what features would support that?\n- What implications does the communication module have on the interoperability of the device with different networks?\n\nImage 2:\n- What occasion might the bouquet in the image be suited for?\n- What types of flowers are included in the bouquet, and what are their botanical names?\n- What is the significance of the flower colors in the context of a cultural or social event?\n- Can the arrangement of the flowers give us clues about the relationship between the giver and receiver?\n- How does the informal presentation of the bouquet affect its perceived value or sentiment?\n\nImage 3:\n- What are the technical differences between the two rockets depicted in the image?\n- Could the proximity of the two rockets suggest a collaboration between space agencies or companies?\n- What might the design and color scheme of the rockets indicate about their respective missions?\n- How does the environment and lighting in the image influence the perception of the rockets' size and power?\n- What kind of payloads might these rockets be designed to carry based on their size?\n\nImage 4:\n- What technique was used to create the elephant towel art?\n- How does the presentation of the towel art add to the guest experience in the context of hospitality?\n- What other forms of art are commonly found in the setting indicated by the image?\n- Does the towel art suggest a certain level of luxury or service in the establishment?\n- How might the elephant shape be perceived by guests from different cultural backgrounds?\n\n<end of candidate questions>\n<start of question>\n{$QUESTION}\nImage 1: How might the data buffer contribute to the performance of the wearable display device?\nImage 2: Can the arrangement of the flowers give us clues about the relationship between the giver and receiver?\nImage 3: What kind of payloads might these rockets be designed to carry based on their size?\nImage 4: How does the presentation of the towel art add to the guest experience in the context of hospitality?\n<end of question>\n<start of answer>\n{$ANSWER}\nImage 1: The data buffer in the wearable display device likely contributes to performance by accommodating data transmission delays or fluctuations, ensuring a smooth and continuous visual experience for the user.
