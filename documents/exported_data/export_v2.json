Here are several emerging trends that are seeing significant breakthroughs:\n\n  * Improving green chemistry predictions/outcomes: One of the biggest challenges in green chemistry is predicting the environmental impact of new chemicals and processes. Researchers are developing new computational tools and models that can help predict these impacts with greater accuracy. This will allow chemists to design safer and more environmentally friendly chemicals.\n  * Reducing plastics: More than 【77†350 million tons†ourworldindata.org】 of plastic waste are generated every year. Across the landscape of manufacturers, suppliers, and retailers, reducing the use of single-use plastics and microplastics is critical. New value-driven approaches by innovators like 【78†MiTerro†www.miterro.com】 that reuse industrial by-products and biomass waste for eco-friendly and cheaper plastic replacements will soon be industry expectations. Lowering costs and plastic footprints will be important throughout the 【79†entire supply chain.†ourworldindata.org】     \n  * Alternative battery chemistry: In the battery and energy storage space, finding alternatives to scarce \"【80†endangered elements\"†crsreports.congress.gov】 like lithium and cobalt will be critical. While essential components of many batteries, they are becoming scarce and expensive. New investments in lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries that do not use nickel and cobalt have 【81†expanded†pubs.acs.org】, with 45% of the EV market share being projected for LFP in 2029. Continued research is projected for more development in 【82†alternative materials†www.newscientist.com】 like sodium, iron, and magnesium, which are more abundant, less expensive, and more sustainable. \n  * More 【83†sustainable catalysts】: Catalysts speed up a chemical reaction or decrease the energy required without getting consumed. Noble metals are excellent catalysts; however, they are expensive and their mining causes environmental damage. Even non-noble metal catalysts can also be toxic due to contamination and challenges with their disposal. Sustainable catalysts are made of earth-abundant elements that are also non-toxic in nature. In recent years, there has been a growing focus on developing sustainable catalysts that are more environmentally friendly and less reliant on precious metals. New developments with catalysts, their roles, and environmental impact will drive meaningful progress in reducing carbon footprints.  \n  * Recycling lithium-ion batteries: 【84†Lithium-ion recycling】 has seen increased 【85†investments†pubs.acs.org】 with more than 800 patents already published in 2023. The use of solid 【86†electrolytes†pubs.acs.org】 or liquid 【87†nonflammable†pubs.acs.org】 【88†electrolytes†pubs.acs.org】 may improve the safety and durability of LIBs and reduce their material use. Finally, a method to manufacture electrodes without 【89†solvent†pubs.acs.org】s could reduce the use of deprecated solvents such as N-methylpyrrolidinone, which require recycling and careful handling to prevent emissions.\n\n## Rise of biomaterials\n\n[Image 3: INSGENENGSOC101826-2024-Trends-To-Watch-Rise-Of-Biomaterials-1920x1080-Hero]\n\nNew materials for biomedical applications could revolutionize many healthcare segments in 2024. One example is bioelectronic materials, which form interfaces between electronic devices and the human body, such as the brain-computer interface system being developed by Neuralink. This system, which uses a network of biocompatible electrodes implanted directly in the brain, was given 【90†FDA approval†www.cnbc.com】 to begin human trials in 2023.\n\n  * Bioelectronic materials: are often hybrids or composites, incorporating nanoscale materials, highly engineered conductive polymers, and bioresorbable substances. Recently developed devices can be implanted, used temporarily, and then safely reabsorbed by the body without the need for removal. This has been demonstrated by a fully bioresorbable, 【91†combined sensor-wireless power receiver†www.nature.com】 made from zinc and the biodegradable polymer, poly(lactic acid).\n  * Natural biomaterials: that are biocompatible and naturally derived (such as chitosan, cellulose nanomaterials, and silk) are used to make advanced multifunctional biomaterials in 2023. For example, they designed an injectable 【92†hydrogel brain implant†biomaterialsres.biomedcentral.com】 for treating Parkinson’s disease, which is based on reversible crosslinks formed between chitosan, tannic acid, and gold nanoparticles.\n  * 【93†Bioinks】: are used for 3D printing of organs and transplant development which could revolutionize patient care. Currently, models are used for studying organ architecture like 【94†3D-printed heart†link.springer.com】 models for cardiac disorders and 【95†3D-printed lung†www.businessweekly.co.uk】 models to test the efficacy of drugs. 【96†Specialized bioinks†www.3dnatives.com】 enhance the quality, efficacy, and versatility of 3D-printed organs, structures, and outcomes. Finally, new approaches like volumetric additive manufacturing (VAM) of pristine 【97†silk-†www.nature.com】based bioinks are unlocking new frontiers of innovation for 3D printing.\n\n## To the moon and beyond\n\n[Image 4: INSGENENGSOC101826-2024-Trends-To-Watch-To-The-Moon-And-Beyond-1920x1080-Hero]\n\nThe global Artemis program is a NASA-led international space exploration program that aims to land the first woman and the first person of color on the 【98†Moon†phys.org】 by 2025 as part of the long-term goal of establishing a sustainable human presence on the Moon. Additionally, the NASA mission called Europa Clipper, scheduled for a 2024 launch, will orbit around Jupiter and fly by 【99†Europa†europa.nasa.gov】, one of Jupiter’s moons, to study the presence of water and its habitability. China’s mission, 【100†Chang’e 6†www.planetary.org】, plans to bring samples from the moon back to Earth for further studies. The Martian Moons Exploration (MMX) mission by Japan’s 【101†JAXA†www.mmx.jaxa.jp】 plans to bring back samples from Phobos, one of the Mars moons. Boeing is also expected to do a test flight of its reusable space capsule 【102†Starliner†www.boeing.com】, which can take people to low-earth orbit.\n\nThe R&D impact of Artemis extends to more fields than just aerospace engineering, though:\n\n  * Robotics: Robots will play a critical role in the Artemis program, performing many tasks, such as collecting samples, building infrastructure, and conducting scientific research. This will drive the development of new robotic technologies, including autonomous systems and dexterous manipulators. \n  * Space medicine: The Artemis program will require the development of new technologies to protect astronauts from the hazards of space travel, such as radiation exposure and microgravity. This will include scientific discoveries in medical diagnostics, therapeutics, and countermeasures.\n  * Earth science: The Artemis program will provide a unique opportunity to study the Moon and its environment. This will lead to new insights into the Earth's history, geology, and climate.\n  * Materials science: The extreme space environment will require new materials that are lightweight, durable, and radiation resistant. This will have applications in many industries, including aerospace, construction, and energy. \n  * Information technology: The Artemis program will generate a massive amount of data, which will need to be processed, analyzed, and shared in real time. This will drive the development of new IT technologies, such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. \n\n## The CRISPR pay-off\n\n[Image 5: INSGENENGSOC101826-2024-Trends-To-Watch-The-CRISPR-Pay-Off-1920x1080-Hero]\n\nAfter years of research, setbacks, and minimal progress, the first formal evidence of CRISPR as a therapeutic 【103†platform technology†innovativegenomics.org】 in the clinic was realized. 【104†Intellia Therapeutics†ir.intelliatx.com】 received FDA clearance to initiate a pivotal phase 3 trial of a new drug for the treatment of hATTR, and using the same Cas9 mRNA, got a new medicine treating a different disease, angioedema. This was achieved by only changing 20 nucleotides of the guide RNA, suggesting that CRISPR can be used as a therapeutic platform technology in the clinic.\n\nThe second great moment for CRISPR drug development technology came when 【105†Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics†news.vrtx.com】 announced the authorization of the first CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited therapy, CASGEVY™, by the United Kingdom MHRA, for the treatment of sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. This was the first approval of a CRISPR-base",

Here are several emerging trends that are seeing significant breakthroughs:\n\n  * Improving green chemistry predictions/outcomes: One of the biggest challenges in green chemistry is predicting the environmental impact of new chemicals and processes. Researchers are developing new computational tools and models that can help predict these impacts with greater accuracy. This will allow chemists to design safer and more environmentally friendly chemicals.\n  * Reducing plastics: More than 【77†350 million tons†ourworldindata.org】 of plastic waste are generated every year. Across the landscape of manufacturers, suppliers, and retailers, reducing the use of single-use plastics and microplastics is critical. New value-driven approaches by innovators like 【78†MiTerro†www.miterro.com】 that reuse industrial by-products and biomass waste for eco-friendly and cheaper plastic replacements will soon be industry expectations. Lowering costs and plastic footprints will be important throughout the 【79†entire supply chain.†ourworldindata.org】     \n  * Alternative battery chemistry: In the battery and energy storage space, finding alternatives to scarce \"【80†endangered elements\"†crsreports.congress.gov】 like lithium and cobalt will be critical. While essential components of many batteries, they are becoming scarce and expensive. New investments in lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries that do not use nickel and cobalt have 【81†expanded†pubs.acs.org】, with 45% of the EV market share being projected for LFP in 2029. Continued research is projected for more development in 【82†alternative materials†www.newscientist.com】 like sodium, iron, and magnesium, which are more abundant, less expensive, and more sustainable. \n  * More 【83†sustainable catalysts】: Catalysts speed up a chemical reaction or decrease the energy required without getting consumed. Noble metals are excellent catalysts; however, they are expensive and their mining causes environmental damage. Even non-noble metal catalysts can also be toxic due to contamination and challenges with their disposal. Sustainable catalysts are made of earth-abundant elements that are also non-toxic in nature. In recent years, there has been a growing focus on developing sustainable catalysts that are more environmentally friendly and less reliant on precious metals. New developments with catalysts, their roles, and environmental impact will drive meaningful progress in reducing carbon footprints.  \n  * Recycling lithium-ion batteries: 【84†Lithium-ion recycling】 has seen increased 【85†investments†pubs.acs.org】 with more than 800 patents already published in 2023. The use of solid 【86†electrolytes†pubs.acs.org】 or liquid 【87†nonflammable†pubs.acs.org】 【88†electrolytes†pubs.acs.org】 may improve the safety and durability of LIBs and reduce their material use. Finally, a method to manufacture electrodes without 【89†solvent†pubs.acs.org】s could reduce the use of deprecated solvents such as N-methylpyrrolidinone, which require recycling and careful handling to prevent emissions.\n\n## Rise of biomaterials\n\n[Image 3: INSGENENGSOC101826-2024-Trends-To-Watch-Rise-Of-Biomaterials-1920x1080-Hero]\n\nNew materials for biomedical applications could revolutionize many healthcare segments in 2024. One example is bioelectronic materials, which form interfaces between electronic devices and the human body, such as the brain-computer interface system being developed by Neuralink. This system, which uses a network of biocompatible electrodes implanted directly in the brain, was given 【90†FDA approval†www.cnbc.com】 to begin human trials in 2023.\n\n  * Bioelectronic materials: are often hybrids or composites, incorporating nanoscale materials, highly engineered conductive polymers, and bioresorbable substances. Recently developed devices can be implanted, used temporarily, and then safely reabsorbed by the body without the need for removal. This has been demonstrated by a fully bioresorbable, 【91†combined sensor-wireless power receiver†www.nature.com】 made from zinc and the biodegradable polymer, poly(lactic acid).\n  * Natural biomaterials: that are biocompatible and naturally derived (such as chitosan, cellulose nanomaterials, and silk) are used to make advanced multifunctional biomaterials in 2023. For example, they designed an injectable 【92†hydrogel brain implant†biomaterialsres.biomedcentral.com】 for treating Parkinson’s disease, which is based on reversible crosslinks formed between chitosan, tannic acid, and gold nanoparticles.\n  * 【93†Bioinks】: are used for 3D printing of organs and transplant development which could revolutionize patient care. Currently, models are used for studying organ architecture like 【94†3D-printed heart†link.springer.com】 models for cardiac disorders and 【95†3D-printed lung†www.businessweekly.co.uk】 models to test the efficacy of drugs. 【96†Specialized bioinks†www.3dnatives.com】 enhance the quality, efficacy, and versatility of 3D-printed organs, structures, and outcomes. Finally, new approaches like volumetric additive manufacturing (VAM) of pristine 【97†silk-†www.nature.com】based bioinks are unlocking new frontiers of innovation for 3D printing.\n\n## To the moon and beyond\n\n[Image 4: INSGENENGSOC101826-2024-Trends-To-Watch-To-The-Moon-And-Beyond-1920x1080-Hero]\n\nThe global Artemis program is a NASA-led international space exploration program that aims to land the first woman and the first person of color on the 【98†Moon†phys.org】 by 2025 as part of the long-term goal of establishing a sustainable human presence on the Moon. Additionally, the NASA mission called Europa Clipper, scheduled for a 2024 launch, will orbit around Jupiter and fly by 【99†Europa†europa.nasa.gov】, one of Jupiter’s moons, to study the presence of water and its habitability. China’s mission, 【100†Chang’e 6†www.planetary.org】, plans to bring samples from the moon back to Earth for further studies. The Martian Moons Exploration (MMX) mission by Japan’s 【101†JAXA†www.mmx.jaxa.jp】 plans to bring back samples from Phobos, one of the Mars moons. Boeing is also expected to do a test flight of its reusable space capsule 【102†Starliner†www.boeing.com】, which can take people to low-earth orbit.\n\nThe R&D impact of Artemis extends to more fields than just aerospace engineering, though:\n\n  * Robotics: Robots will play a critical role in the Artemis program, performing many tasks, such as collecting samples, building infrastructure, and conducting scientific research. This will drive the development of new robotic technologies, including autonomous systems and dexterous manipulators. \n  * Space medicine: The Artemis program will require the development of new technologies to protect astronauts from the hazards of space travel, such as radiation exposure and microgravity. This will include scientific discoveries in medical diagnostics, therapeutics, and countermeasures.\n  * Earth science: The Artemis program will provide a unique opportunity to study the Moon and its environment. This will lead to new insights into the Earth's history, geology, and climate.\n  * Materials science: The extreme space environment will require new materials that are lightweight, durable, and radiation resistant. This will have applications in many industries, including aerospace, construction, and energy. \n  * Information technology: The Artemis program will generate a massive amount of data, which will need to be processed, analyzed, and shared in real time. This will drive the development of new IT technologies, such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. \n\n## The CRISPR pay-off\n\n[Image 5: INSGENENGSOC101826-2024-Trends-To-Watch-The-CRISPR-Pay-Off-1920x1080-Hero]\n\nAfter years of research, setbacks, and minimal progress, the first formal evidence of CRISPR as a therapeutic 【103†platform technology†innovativegenomics.org】 in the clinic was realized. 【104†Intellia Therapeutics†ir.intelliatx.com】 received FDA clearance to initiate a pivotal phase 3 trial of a new drug for the treatment of hATTR, and using the same Cas9 mRNA, got a new medicine treating a different disease, angioedema. This was achieved by only changing 20 nucleotides of the guide RNA, suggesting that CRISPR can be used as a therapeutic platform technology in the clinic.\n\nThe second great moment for CRISPR drug development technology came when 【105†Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics†news.vrtx.com】 announced the authorization of the first CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited therapy, CASGEVY™, by the United Kingdom MHRA, for the treatment of sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. This was the first approval of a CRISPR-base",

              "text": "\nBut of course, the success of this plan hinges on whether these models work reliably. Language models often make stuff up, and generative models are 【19†riddled with biases】. They are also 【20†easy to hack】, especially if they are allowed to browse the web. Tech companies have not solved any of these problems. When the novelty wears off, they’ll have to offer their customers ways to deal with these problems. \n\n—Melissa Heikkil ä\n\n[Image 1: a film clapper with digital patter where the production info should be]\n\nSTEPHANIE ARNETT/MITTR | ENVATO\n\n### 2\n\n#### Generative AI’s second wave will be video\n\nIt’s amazing how fast the fantastic becomes familiar. The first generative models to produce photorealistic images【21† exploded into the mainstream in 2022】—and soon became commonplace. Tools like OpenAI’s DALL-E, Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion, and Adobe’s Firefly flooded the internet with jaw-dropping images of everything from the pope in Balenciaga to【22† prize-winning art†www.nytimes.com】. But it’s not all good fun: for every【23† pug waving pompoms】, there’s another piece of【24† knock-off fantasy art】 or【25† sexist sexual stereotyping】.\n\nThe new frontier is text-to-video. Expect it to take everything that was good, bad, or ugly about text-to-image and supersize it.\n\nA year ago we got the【26† first glimpse】 of what generative models could do when they were trained to stitch together multiple still images into clips a few seconds long. The results were distorted and jerky. But the tech has rapidly improved.\n\n【27†Runway】, a startup that makes generative video models (and the company that co-created Stable Diffusion), is dropping new versions of its tools every few months. Its latest model, called【28† Gen-2†research.runwayml.com】, still generates video just a few seconds long, but the quality is striking. The【29† best clips†twitter.com】 aren’t far off what Pixar might put out.\n\nRunway has set up an annual【30† AI film festival†aiff.runwayml.com】 that showcases【31† experimental movies】 made with a range of AI tools. This year’s festival has a $60,000 prize pot, and the 10 best films will be screened in New York and Los Angeles.\n\nIt’s no surprise that top studios are taking notice. Movie giants, including Paramount and Disney, are now exploring the use of generative AI throughout their production pipeline. The tech is being used to lip-sync actors’ performances to multiple foreign-language overdubs. And it is reinventing what’s possible with special effects. In 2023, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny starred a de-aged deepfake Harrison Ford. This is just the start.  \n\nAway from the big screen, deepfake tech for marketing or training purposes is taking off too. For example, UK-based Synthesia makes tools that can turn a one-off performance by an actor into an endless stream of deepfake avatars, reciting whatever script you give them at the push of a button. According to the company, its tech is now used by 44% of Fortune 100 companies. \n\nThe ability to do so much with so little 【16†raises serious questions for actors】. Concerns about studios’ use and misuse of AI were at the heart of the SAG-AFTRA strikes last year. But the true impact of the tech is only just becoming apparent. “The craft of filmmaking is fundamentally changing,” says Souki Mehdaoui, an independent filmmaker and cofounder of Bell & Whistle, a consultancy specializing in creative technologies.\n\n—Will Douglas Heaven\n\n### 3\n\n#### AI-generated election disinformation will be everywhere \n\nIf recent elections are anything to go by, AI-generated election disinformation and deepfakes are going to be a huge problem as a record number of people march to the polls in 2024.

By showing OpenAI’s GPT-3 a few additional examples (known as fine-tuning), researchers can train it to solve coding problems, write movie scripts, pass high school biology exams, and so on. Multimodal models, like GPT-4 and Google DeepMind’s Gemini, can solve visual tasks as well as linguistic ones.\n\nThe same approach can work for robots, so it wouldn’t be necessary to train one to flip pancakes and another to open doors: a one-size-fits-all model could give robots the ability to multitask. Several examples of work in this area emerged in 2023.\n\nIn June, DeepMind released【38† Robocat†deepmind.google】 (an update on last year’s【39† Gato】), which generates its own data from trial and error to learn how to control many different robot arms (instead of one specific arm, which is more typical). \n\nIn October, the company put out yet another general-purpose model for robots, called RT-X, and a【40† big new general-purpose training data set†deepmind.google】, in collaboration with 33 university labs. Other top research teams, such as RAIL (Robotic Artificial Intelligence and Learning) at the University of California, Berkeley, are looking at similar tech.\n\nThe problem is a lack of data. Generative AI draws on an internet-size data set of text and images. In comparison, robots have very few good sources of data to help them learn how to do many of the industrial or domestic tasks we want them to.\n\n【41†Lerrel Pinto】 at New York University leads one team addressing that. He and his colleagues are developing techniques that let robots learn by trial and error, coming up with their own training data as they go. In an even more low-key project, Pinto has recruited volunteers to collect video data from around their homes using an【42† iPhone camera mounted to a trash picker】. Big companies have also started to release large data sets for training robots in the last couple of years, such as【43† Meta’s Ego4D】.\n\nThis approach is already showing promise in driverless cars. Startups such as Wayve, Waabi, and Ghost are pioneering a【44† new wave of self-driving AI】 that uses a single large model to control a vehicle rather than multiple smaller models to control specific driving tasks. This has let small companies catch up with giants like Cruise and Waymo. Wayve is now testing its driverless cars on the narrow, busy streets of London. Robots everywhere are set to get a similar boost.\n\n—Will Douglas Heaven\n\nhide \n\n### by 【8†Melissa Heikkilä】 & 【9†Will Douglas Heaven】\n\n### Share\n\n  * 【45†linkedin link opens in a new window†www.linkedin.com】\n  * 【46†twitter link opens in a new window†twitter.com】\n  * 【",

                    "text": "\nBut of course, the success of this plan hinges on whether these models work reliably. Language models often make stuff up, and generative models are 【19†riddled with biases】. They are also 【20†easy to hack】, especially if they are allowed to browse the web. Tech companies have not solved any of these problems. When the novelty wears off, they’ll have to offer their customers ways to deal with these problems. \n\n—Melissa Heikkil ä\n\n[Image 1: a film clapper with digital patter where the production info should be]\n\nSTEPHANIE ARNETT/MITTR | ENVATO\n\n### 2\n\n#### Generative AI’s second wave will be video\n\nIt’s amazing how fast the fantastic becomes familiar. The first generative models to produce photorealistic images【21† exploded into the mainstream in 2022】—and soon became commonplace. Tools like OpenAI’s DALL-E, Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion, and Adobe’s Firefly flooded the internet with jaw-dropping images of everything from the pope in Balenciaga to【22† prize-winning art†www.nytimes.com】. But it’s not all good fun: for every【23† pug waving pompoms】, there’s another piece of【24† knock-off fantasy art】 or【25† sexist sexual stereotyping】.\n\nThe new frontier is text-to-video. Expect it to take everything that was good, bad, or ugly about text-to-image and supersize it.\n\nA year ago we got the【26† first glimpse】 of what generative models could do when they were trained to stitch together multiple still images into clips a few seconds long. The results were distorted and jerky. But the tech has rapidly improved.\n\n【27†Runway】, a startup that makes generative video models (and the company that co-created Stable Diffusion), is dropping new versions of its tools every few months. Its latest model, called【28† Gen-2†research.runwayml.com】, still generates video just a few seconds long, but the quality is striking. The【29† best clips†twitter.com】 aren’t far off what Pixar might put out.\n\nRunway has set up an annual【30† AI film festival†aiff.runwayml.com】 that showcases【31† experimental movies】 made with a range of AI tools. This year’s festival has a $60,000 prize pot, and the 10 best films will be screened in New York and Los Angeles.\n\nIt’s no surprise that top studios are taking notice. Movie giants, including Paramount and Disney, are now exploring the use of generative AI throughout their production pipeline. The tech is being used to lip-sync actors’ performances to multiple foreign-language overdubs. And it is reinventing what’s possible with special effects. In 2023, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny starred a de-aged deepfake Harrison Ford. This is just the start.  \n\nAway from the big screen, deepfake tech for marketing or training purposes is taking off too. For example, UK-based Synthesia makes tools that can turn a one-off performance by an actor into an endless stream of deepfake avatars, reciting whatever script you give them at the push of a button. According to the company, its tech is now used by 44% of Fortune 100 companies. \n\nThe ability to do so much with so little 【16†raises serious questions for actors】. Concerns about studios’ use and misuse of AI were at the heart of the SAG-AFTRA strikes last year. But the true impact of the tech is only just becoming apparent. “The craft of filmmaking is fundamentally changing,” says Souki Mehdaoui, an independent filmmaker and cofounder of Bell & Whistle, a consultancy specializing in creative technologies.\n\n—Will Douglas Heaven\n\n### 3\n\n#### AI-generated election disinformation will be everywhere \n\nIf recent elections are anything to go by, AI-generated election disinformation and deepfakes are going to be a huge problem as a record number of people march to the polls in 2024. We’re already seeing politicians weaponizing these tools. In 【32†Argentina†www.nytimes.com】, two presidential candidates created AI-generated images and videos of their opponents to attack them. In 【33†Slovakia†www.bloomberg.com】, deepfakes of a liberal pro-European party leader threatening to raise the price of beer and making jokes about child pornography spread like wildfire during the country’s elections. And in the US, Donald Trump has 【34†cheered on†www.nytimes.com】 a group that uses AI to generate memes with racist and sexist tropes. \n\n## Related Story\n\n【35†Looking back to look forward】\n\nThis magazine's 125 years of history is fascinating—but only if we use it to help us understand where technology is headed next.\n\nWhile it’s hard to say how much these examples have influenced the outcomes of elections, their proliferation is a worrying trend.

              "text": "\nStephanie Arnett/MITTR\n\nOpenAI has announced the first results from its 【9†superalignment team†openai.com】, the firm’s in-house initiative dedicated to preventing a superintelligence—a hypothetical future computer that can outsmart humans—from going rogue.\n\nUnlike many of the company’s announcements, this heralds no big breakthrough. In a low-key research paper, the team describes a technique that lets a less powerful large language model supervise a more powerful one—and suggests that this might be a small step toward figuring out how humans might supervise superhuman machines.  \n\nLess than a month after OpenAI was rocked by a crisis when its CEO, Sam Altman, was fired by its oversight board (in an apparent coup led by chief scientist Ilya Sutskever) and then reinstated three days later, the message is clear: it’s back to business as usual.\n\nYet OpenAI’s business is not usual. Many researchers still question whether machines will ever match human intelligence, let alone outmatch it. OpenAI’s team takes machines’ eventual superiority as given. “AI progress in the last few years has been just extraordinarily rapid,” says Leopold Aschenbrenner, a researcher on the superalignment team. “We’ve been crushing all the benchmarks, and that progress is continuing unabated.”\n\nFor Aschenbrenner and others at the company, models with human-like abilities are just around the corner. “But it won’t stop there,” he says. “We’re going to have superhuman models, models that are much smarter than us. And that presents fundamental new technical challenges.”\n\nIn July, Sutskever and fellow OpenAI scientist Jan Leike set up the superalignment team to address those challenges. “I’m doing it for my own self-interest,” Sutskever 【10†told MIT Technology Review in September】. “It’s obviously important that any superintelligence anyone builds does not go rogue. Obviously.”\n\nAmid speculation that Altman was fired for playing fast and loose with his company’s approach to AI safety, Sutskever’s superalignment team loomed behind the headlines. Many have been waiting to see exactly what it has been up to. \n\n### Dos and don'ts\n\nThe question the team wants to answer is how to rein in, or “align,” hypothetical future models that are far smarter than we are, known as superhuman models. Alignment means making sure a model does what you want it to do and does not do what you don’t want it to do. Superalignment applies this idea to superhuman models.\n\nOne of the most widespread techniques used to align existing models is called reinforcement learning via human feedback. In a nutshell, human testers score a model’s responses, upvoting behavior that they want to see and downvoting behavior they don’t. This feedback is then used to train the model to produce only the kind of responses that human testers liked. This technique is a big part of what makes ChatGPT so engaging.   \n\nThe problem is that it requires humans to be able to tell what is and isn’t desirable behavior in the first place. But a superhuman model—the idea goes—might do things that a human tester can’t understand and thus would not be able to score. (It might even try to hide its true behavior from humans, Sutskever told us.)  \n\n[Image 1]OpenAI's approach to the superalignment problem.\n\nOPENAI\n\nThe researchers point out that the problem is hard to study because superhuman machines do not exist. So they used stand-ins. Instead of looking at how humans could supervise superhuman machines, they looked at how GPT-2, a model that OpenAI released five years ago, could supervise GPT-4, OpenAI’s latest and most powerful model. “If you can do that, it might be evidence that you can use similar techniques to have humans supervise superhuman models,” says Collin Burns, another researcher on the superalignment team.   \n\nThe team took GPT-2 and trained it to perform a handful of different tasks, including a set of chess puzzles and 22 common natural-language-processing tests that assess inference, sentiment analysis, and so on. They used GPT-2’s responses to those tests and puzzles to train GPT-4 to perform the same tasks. It’s as if a 12th grader were taught how to do a task by a third grader. The trick was to do it without GPT-4 taking too big a hit in performance.\n\nThe results were mixed. The team measured the gap in performance between GPT-4 trained on GPT-2’s best guesses and GPT-4 trained on correct answers. They found that GPT-4 trained by GPT-2 performed 20% to 70% better than GPT-2 on the language tasks but did less well on the chess puzzles.\n\nThe fact that GPT-4 outdid its teacher at all is impressive, says team member Pavel Izmailov: “This is a really surprising and positive result.” But it fell far short of what it could do by itself, he says. They conclude that the approach is promising but needs more work.\n\n“It is an interesting idea,” says Thilo Hagendorff, an AI researcher at the University of Stuttgart in Germany who works on alignment. But he thinks that GPT-2 might be too dumb to be a good teacher. “GPT-2 tends to give nonsensical responses to any task that is slightly complex or requires reasoning,” he says. Hagendorff would like to know what would happen if GPT-3 were used instead.\n\nHe also notes that this approach does not address Sutskever’s hypothetical scenario in which a superintelligence hides its true behavior and pretends to be aligned when it isn’t. “Future superhuman models will likely possess emergent abilities which are unknown to researchers,” says Hagendorff. “How can alignment work in these cases?”\n\nBut it is easy to point out shortcomings, he says. He is pleased to see OpenAI moving from speculation to experiment: “I applaud OpenAI for their effort.”\n\nOpenAI now wants to recruit others to its cause. Alongside this research update, the company announced a 【11†new $10 million money pot†openai.com】 that it plans to use to fund people working on superalignment. It will offer grants of up to $2 million to university labs, nonprofits, and individual researchers and one-year fellowships of $150,000 to graduate students. “We’re really excited about this,” says Aschenbrenner. “We really think there’s a lot that new researchers can contribute.”\n\nhide \n\n### by 【8†Will Douglas Heaven】\n\n### Share\n\n  * 【12†linkedin link opens in a new window†www.linkedin.com】\n  * 【13†twitter link opens in a new window†twitter.com】\n  * 【14†facebook link opens in a new window†www.facebook.com】\n  * email link opens in a new window \n\n  *   * ### Popular\n\n    1. 【15†10 Breakthrough Technologies 2024】【16†The Editors】\n    2. 【17†Scientists are finding signals of long covid in blood.

Many researchers still question whether machines will ever match human intelligence, let alone outmatch it. OpenAI’s team takes machines’ eventual superiority as given. “AI progress in the last few years has been just extraordinarily rapid,” says Leopold Aschenbrenner, a researcher on the superalignment team. “We’ve been crushing all the benchmarks, and that progress is continuing unabated.”\n\nFor Aschenbrenner and others at the company, models with human-like abilities are just around the corner. “But it won’t stop there,” he says. “We’re going to have superhuman models, models that are much smarter than us. And that presents fundamental new technical challenges.”\n\nIn July, Sutskever and fellow OpenAI scientist Jan Leike set up the superalignment team to address those challenges. “I’m doing it for my own self-interest,” Sutskever 【10†told MIT Technology Review in September】. “It’s obviously important that any superintelligence anyone builds does not go rogue. Obviously.”\n\nAmid speculation that Altman was fired for playing fast and loose with his company’s approach to AI safety, Sutskever’s superalignment team loomed behind the headlines. Many have been waiting to see exactly what it has been up to. \n\n### Dos and don'ts\n\nThe question the team wants to answer is how to rein in, or “align,” hypothetical future models that are far smarter than we are, known as superhuman models. Alignment means making sure a model does what you want it to do and does not do what you don’t want it to do. Superalignment applies this idea to superhuman models.\n\nOne of the most widespread techniques used to align existing models is called reinforcement learning via human feedback. In a nutshell, human testers score a model’s responses, upvoting behavior that they want to see and downvoting behavior they don’t. This feedback is then used to train the model to produce only the kind of responses that human testers liked. This technique is a big part of what makes ChatGPT so engaging.   \n\nThe problem is that it requires humans to be able to tell what is and isn’t desirable behavior in the first place. But a superhuman model—the idea goes—might do things that a human tester can’t understand and thus would not be able to score. (It might even try to hide its true behavior from humans, Sutskever told us.)  \n\n[Image 1]OpenAI's approach to the superalignment problem.\n\nOPENAI\n\nThe researchers point out that the problem is hard to study because superhuman machines do not exist. So they used stand-ins. Instead of looking at how humans could supervise superhuman machines, they looked at how GPT-2, a model that OpenAI released five years ago, could supervise GPT-4, OpenAI’s latest and most powerful model. “If you can do that, it might be evidence that you can use similar techniques to have humans supervise superhuman models,” says Collin Burns, another researcher on the superalignment team.   \n\nThe team took GPT-2 and trained it to perform a handful of different tasks, including a set of chess puzzles and 22 common natural-language-processing tests that assess inference, sentiment analysis, and so on. They used GPT-2’s responses to those tests and puzzles to train GPT-4 to perform the same tasks. It’s as if a 12th grader were taught how to do a task by a third grader. The trick was to do it without GPT-4 taking too big a hit in performance.\n\nThe results were mixed. The team measured the gap in performance between GPT-4 trained on GPT-2’s best guesses and GPT-4 trained on correct answers. They found that GPT-4 trained by GPT-2 performed 20% to 70% better than GPT-2 on the language tasks but did less well on the chess puzzles.\n\nThe fact that GPT-4 outdid its teacher at all is impressive, says team member Pavel Izmailov: “This is a really surprising and positive result.” But it fell far short of what it could do by itself, he says. They conclude that the approach is promising but needs more work.\n\n“It is an interesting idea,” says Thilo Hagendorff, an AI researcher at the University of Stuttgart in Germany who works on alignment. But he thinks that GPT-2 might be too dumb to be a good teacher. “GPT-2 tends to give nonsensical responses to any task that is slightly complex or requires reasoning,” he says. Hagendorff would like to know what would happen if GPT-3 were used instead.\n\nHe also notes that this approach does not address Sutskever’s hypothetical scenario in which a superintelligence hides its true behavior and pretends to be aligned when it isn’t. “Future superhuman models will likely possess emergent abilities which are unknown to researchers,” says Hagendorff. “How can alignment work in these cases?”\n\nBut it is easy to point out shortcomings, he says. He is pleased to see OpenAI moving from speculation to experiment: “I applaud OpenAI for their effort.”\n\nOpenAI now wants to recruit others to its cause. Alongside this research update, the company announced a 【11†new $10 million money pot†openai.com】 that it plans to use to fund people working on superalignment. It will offer grants of up to $2 million to university labs, nonprofits, and individual researchers and one-year fellowships of $150,000 to graduate students. “We’re really excited about this,” says Aschenbrenner. “We really think there’s a lot that new researchers can contribute.”\n\nhide \n\n### by 【8†Will Douglas Heaven】\n\n### Share\n\n  * 【12†linkedin link opens in a new window†www.linkedin.com】\n  * 【13†twitter link opens in a new window†twitter.com】\n  * 【14†facebook link opens in a new window†www.facebook.com】\n  * email link opens in a new window \n\n  *   * ### Popular\n\n    1. 【15†10 Breakthrough Technologies 2024】【16†The Editors】\n    2. 【17†Scientists are finding signals of long covid in blood.

              "text": "\nThe first generative models that could produce video from snippets of text appeared in late 2022. But 【11†early examples from Meta】, Google, and a startup called 【14†Runway】 were glitchy and grainy. Since then, the tech has been getting better fast. Runway’s gen-2 model, released last year, can produce short clips that come close to matching big-studio animation in their quality. But most of these examples are still only a few seconds long.  \n\nThe sample videos from OpenAI’s Sora are high-definition and full of detail. OpenAI also says it can generate videos up to a minute long. One video of a Tokyo street scene shows that Sora has learned how objects fit together in 3D: the camera swoops into the scene to follow a couple as they walk past a row of shops.\n\n## Related Story\n\n【15†Welcome to the new surreal: How AI-generated video is changing film.】\n\nExclusive: Watch the world premiere of the AI-generated short film The Frost.\n\nOpenAI also claims that Sora handles occlusion well. One problem with existing models is that they can fail to keep track of objects when they drop out of view. For example, if a truck passes in front of a street sign, the sign might not reappear afterward.  \n\nIn a video of a papercraft underwater scene, Sora has added what look like cuts between different pieces of footage, and the model has maintained a consistent style between them.\n\nIt’s not perfect. In the Tokyo video, cars to the left look smaller than the people walking beside them. They also pop in and out between the tree branches. “There’s definitely some work to be done in terms of long-term coherence,” says Brooks. “For example, if someone goes out of view for a long time, they won’t come back. The model kind of forgets that they were supposed to be there.”\n\n### Tech tease\n\nImpressive as they are, the sample videos shown here were 【16†no doubt cherry-picked】 to show Sora at its best. Without more information, it is hard to know how representative they are of the model’s typical output.   \n\nIt may be some time before we find out. OpenAI’s announcement of Sora today is a tech tease, and the company says it has no current plans to release it to the public. Instead, OpenAI will today begin sharing the model with third-party safety testers for the first time.\n\nIn particular, the firm is worried about the 【17†potential misuses】 of 【18†fake but photorealistic video】. “We’re being careful about deployment here and making sure we have all our bases covered before we put this in the hands of the general public,” says Aditya Ramesh, a scientist at OpenAI, who created the firm’s 【19†text-to-image model DALL-E】.\n\nBut OpenAI is eyeing a product launch sometime in the future. As well as safety testers, the company is also sharing the model with a select group of video makers and artists to get feedback on how to make Sora as useful as possible to creative professionals. “The other goal is to show everyone what is on the horizon, to give a preview of what these models will be capable of,” says Ramesh.\n\nTo build Sora, the team adapted the tech behind DALL-E 3, the latest version of OpenAI’s flagship text-to-image model. Like most text-to-image models, DALL-E 3 uses what’s known as a diffusion model. These are trained to turn a fuzz of random pixels into a picture.\n\nSora takes this approach and applies it to videos rather than still images. But the researchers also added another technique to the mix. Unlike DALL-E or most other generative video models, Sora combines its diffusion model with a type of neural network called a transformer.\n\nTransformers are great at processing long sequences of data, like words. That has made them the special sauce inside large language models like OpenAI’s 【20†GPT-4】 and Google DeepMind’s 【21†Gemini】. But videos are not made of words. Instead, the researchers had to find a way to cut videos into chunks that could be treated as if they were. The approach they came up with was to dice videos up across both space and time. “It’s like if you were to have a stack of all the video frames and you cut little cubes from it,” says Brooks.\n\nThe transformer inside Sora can then process these chunks of video data in much the same way that the transformer inside a large language model processes words in a block of text. The researchers say that this let them train Sora on many more types of video than other text-to-video models, varied in terms of resolution, duration, aspect ratio, and orientation. “It really helps the model,” says Brooks. “That is something that we’re not aware of any existing work on.”\n\nPROMPT: Several giant wooly mammoths approach treading through a snowy meadow, their long wooly fur lightly blows in the wind as they walk, snow covered trees and dramatic snow capped mountains in the distance, mid afternoon light with wispy clouds and a sun high in the distance creates a warm glow, the low camera view is stunning capturing the large furry mammal with beautiful photography, depth of field (Credit: OpenAI)  \nPROMPT: Beautiful, snowy Tokyo city is bustling. The camera moves through the bustling city street, following several people enjoying the beautiful snowy weather and shopping at nearby stalls. Gorgeous sakura petals are flying through the wind along with snowflakes. (Credit: OpenAI)\n\n“From a technical perspective it seems like a very significant leap forward,” says Sam Gregory, executive director at Witness, a human rights organization that specializes in the use and misuse of video technology. “But there are two sides to the coin,” he says. “The expressive capabilities offer the potential for many more people to be storytellers using video. And there are also real potential avenues for misuse.” \n\nOpenAI is well aware of the risks that come with a generative video model. We are already seeing the 【22†large-scale misuse of deepfake images】. Photorealistic video takes this to another level.\n\nGregory notes that you could use technology like this to misinform people about conflict zones or protests. The range of styles is also interesting, he says. If you could generate shaky footage that looked like something shot with a phone, it would come across as more authentic. \n\nThe tech is not there yet, but generative video has gone from zero to Sora in just 18 months. “We’re going to be entering a universe where there will be fully synthetic content, human-generated content and a mix of the two,” says Gregory. \n\nThe OpenAI team plans to draw on the safety testing it did last year for DALL-E 3. Sora already includes a filter that runs on all prompts sent to the model that will block requests for violent, sexual, or hateful images, as well as images of known people. Another filter will look at frames of generated videos and block material that violates OpenAI’s safety policies.\n\nOpenAI says it is also adapting a fake-image detector developed for DALL-E 3 to use with Sora. And the company will embed 【23†industry-standard C2PA tags】, metadata that states how an image was generated, into all of Sora’s output. But these steps are far from foolproof.

                    "text": "\nThe first generative models that could produce video from snippets of text appeared in late 2022. But 【11†early examples from Meta】, Google, and a startup called 【14†Runway】 were glitchy and grainy. Since then, the tech has been getting better fast. Runway’s gen-2 model, released last year, can produce short clips that come close to matching big-studio animation in their quality. But most of these examples are still only a few seconds long.  \n\nThe sample videos from OpenAI’s Sora are high-definition and full of detail. OpenAI also says it can generate videos up to a minute long. One video of a Tokyo street scene shows that Sora has learned how objects fit together in 3D: the camera swoops into the scene to follow a couple as they walk past a row of shops.\n\n## Related Story\n\n【15†Welcome to the new surreal: How AI-generated video is changing film.】\n\nExclusive: Watch the world premiere of the AI-generated short film The Frost.\n\nOpenAI also claims that Sora handles occlusion well. One problem with existing models is that they can fail to keep track of objects when they drop out of view. For example, if a truck passes in front of a street sign, the sign might not reappear afterward.  \n\nIn a video of a papercraft underwater scene, Sora has added what look like cuts between different pieces of footage, and the model has maintained a consistent style between them.\n\nIt’s not perfect. In the Tokyo video, cars to the left look smaller than the people walking beside them. They also pop in and out between the tree branches. “There’s definitely some work to be done in terms of long-term coherence,” says Brooks. “For example, if someone goes out of view for a long time, they won’t come back. The model kind of forgets that they were supposed to be there.”\n\n### Tech tease\n\nImpressive as they are, the sample videos shown here were 【16†no doubt cherry-picked】 to show Sora at its best. Without more information, it is hard to know how representative they are of the model’s typical output.   \n\nIt may be some time before we find out. OpenAI’s announcement of Sora today is a tech tease, and the company says it has no current plans to release it to the public. Instead, OpenAI will today begin sharing the model with third-party safety testers for the first time.\n\nIn particular, the firm is worried about the 【17†potential misuses】 of 【18†fake but photorealistic video】. “We’re being careful about deployment here and making sure we have all our bases covered before we put this in the hands of the general public,” says Aditya Ramesh, a scientist at OpenAI, who created the firm’s 【19†text-to-image model DALL-E】.\n\nBut OpenAI is eyeing a product launch sometime in the future. As well as safety testers, the company is also sharing the model with a select group of video makers and artists to get feedback on how to make Sora as useful as possible to creative professionals. “The other goal is to show everyone what is on the horizon, to give a preview of what these models will be capable of,” says Ramesh.\n\nTo build Sora, the team adapted the tech behind DALL-E 3, the latest version of OpenAI’s flagship text-to-image model. Like most text-to-image models, DALL-E 3 uses what’s known as a diffusion model. These are trained to turn a fuzz of random pixels into a picture.\n\nSora takes this approach and applies it to videos rather than still images. But the researchers also added another technique to the mix. Unlike DALL-E or most other generative video models, Sora combines its diffusion model with a type of neural network called a transformer.\n\nTransformers are great at processing long sequences of data, like words. That has made them the special sauce inside large language models like OpenAI’s 【20†GPT-4】 and Google DeepMind’s 【21†Gemini】. But videos are not made of words. Instead, the researchers had to find a way to cut videos into chunks that could be treated as if they were. The approach they came up with was to dice videos up across both space and time. “It’s like if you were to have a stack of all the video frames and you cut little cubes from it,” says Brooks.\n\nThe transformer inside Sora can then process these chunks of video data in much the same way that the transformer inside a large language model processes words in a block of text. The researchers say that this let them train Sora on many more types of video than other text-to-video models, varied in terms of resolution, duration, aspect ratio, and orientation. “It really helps the model,” says Brooks. “That is something that we’re not aware of any existing work on.”\n\nPROMPT: Several giant wooly mammoths approach treading through a snowy meadow, their long wooly fur lightly blows in the wind as they walk, snow covered trees and dramatic snow capped mountains in the distance, mid afternoon light with wispy clouds and a sun high in the distance creates a warm glow, the low camera view is stunning capturing the large furry mammal with beautiful photography, depth of field (Credit: OpenAI)  \nPROMPT: Beautiful, snowy Tokyo city is bustling. The camera moves through the bustling city street, following several people enjoying the beautiful snowy weather and shopping at nearby stalls. Gorgeous sakura petals are flying through the wind along with snowflakes. (Credit: OpenAI)\n\n“From a technical perspective it seems like a very significant leap forward,” says Sam Gregory, executive director at Witness, a human rights organization that specializes in the use and misuse of video technology. “But there are two sides to the coin,” he says. “The expressive capabilities offer the potential for many more people to be storytellers using video. And there are also real potential avenues for misuse.” \n\nOpenAI is well aware of the risks that come with a generative video model. We are already seeing the 【22†large-scale misuse of deepfake images】. Photorealistic video takes this to another level.\n\nGregory notes that you could use technology like this to misinform people about conflict zones or protests. The range of styles is also interesting, he says. If you could generate shaky footage that looked like something shot with a phone, it would come across as more authentic. \n\nThe tech is not there yet, but generative video has gone from zero to Sora in just 18 months. “We’re going to be entering a universe where there will be fully synthetic content, human-generated content and a mix of the two,” says Gregory. \n\nThe OpenAI team plans to draw on the safety testing it did last year for DALL-E 3. Sora already includes a filter that runs on all prompts sent to the model that will block requests for violent, sexual, or hateful images, as well as images of known people. Another filter will look at frames of generated videos and block material that violates OpenAI’s safety policies.\n\nOpenAI says it is also adapting a fake-image detector developed for DALL-E 3 to use with Sora. And the company will embed 【23†industry-standard C2PA tags】, metadata that states how an image was generated, into all of Sora’s output. But these steps are far from foolproof. Fake-image detectors are hit-or-miss. Metadata is easy to remove, and most social media sites strip it from uploaded images by default.  \n\n“We’ll definitely need to get more feedback and learn more about the types of risks that need to be addressed with video before it would make sense for us to release this,” says Ramesh.\n\nBrooks agrees. “Part of the reason that we’re talking about this research now is so that we can start getting the input that we need to do the work necessary to figure out how it could be safely deployed,” he says.\n\nUpdate 2/15: Comments from Sam Gregory were added.\n\nhide \n\n### by 【8†Will Douglas Heaven】\n\n### Share\n\n  * 【24†linkedin link opens in a new window†www.linkedin.com】\n  * 【25†twitter link opens in a new window†twitter.com】\n  * 【26†facebook link opens in a new window†www.facebook.com】\n  * email link opens in a new window \n\n  *   * ### Popular\n\n    1. 【27†10 Breakthrough Technologies 2024】【28†The Editors】\n    2. 【29†Scientists are finding signals of long covid in blood.

              "text": "\n## WHAT IS SORA? CAN I USE IT YET?\n\nSora is a text-to-video generator—creating videos up to 60 seconds long based on written prompts using generative AI. The model can also generate video from an existing still image.\n\nGenerative AI is a branch of AI that can create something new. Examples include chatbots, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, and image-generators such as DALL-E and Midjourney. Getting an AI system to generate videos is newer and more challenging but relies on some of the same technology.\n\nSora isn't available for public use yet (OpenAI says it's engaging with policymakers and artists before officially releasing the tool) and there's a lot we still don't know. But since Thursday's announcement, the company has shared a handful of examples of Sora-generated videos to show off what it can do.\n\nOpenAI CEO 【30†Sam Altman】 also took to X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, to ask social media users to send in prompt ideas. He later shared realistically-detailed videos that responded to prompts like \"two golden retrievers 【31†podcasting on top of a mountain†twitter.com】 \" and \"a 【32†bicycle race on ocean†twitter.com】 with different animals as athletes riding the bicycles with drone camera view.\"\n\nWhile Sora-generated videos are able to depict complex, incredibly-detailed scenes, OpenAI notes that there are still some weaknesses—including some spatial and cause-and-effect elements. For example, OpenAI adds on its website, \"a person might take a bite out of a cookie, but afterward, the cookie may not have a bite mark.\"\n\n## ARE THERE OTHER AI-GENERATED VIDEO TOOLS OUT THERE TODAY?\n\nOpenAI's Sora isn't the first of its kind. Google, Meta and the startup Runway ML are among the other companies to have demonstrated similar technology.\n\nStill, 【33†industry analysts】 stress the apparent quality and and impressive length of Sora videos shared so far. Fred Havemeyer, head of U.S. AI and software research at Macquarie, said that Sora's launch marks a big step forward for the industry.\n\n\"Not only can you do longer videos, I understand up to 60 seconds, but also the videos being created look more normal and seem to actually respect physics and the real world more,\" Havemeyer said. \"You're not getting as many 'uncanny valley' videos or fragments on the video feeds that look ... unnatural.\"\n\nWhile there has been \"tremendous progress\" in AI-generated video over the last year—including Stable Video Diffusion's introduction last November—Forrester senior analyst Rowan Curran said such videos have required more \"stitching together\" for character and scene consistency.\n\nThe consistency and length of Sora's videos, however, represents \"new opportunities for creatives to incorporate elements of AI-generated video into more traditional content, and now even to generate full-blown narrative videos from one or a few prompts,\" Curran told The Associated Press via email Friday.\n\n## WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL RISKS?\n\nAlthough Sora's abilities have astounded observers since Thursday's launch, anxiety over ethical and societal implications of AI-generated video uses also remains.\n\nHavemeyer points to the substantial risks in 2024's potentially-fraught election cycle, for example. Having a \"potentially magical\" way to generate videos that may look and sound realistic presents a number of issues within politics and beyond, he added—pointing to fraud, propaganda and misinformation concerns.\n\n\"The negative externalities of generative AI will be a critical topic for debate in 2024,\" Havemeyer said. \"It's a substantial issue that every business and every person will need to face this year.\"\n\nTech companies are still calling the shots when it comes to governing AI and its risks as governments around the world work to catch up. In December, the European Union reached a deal on the world's first comprehensive AI rules, but the act won't take effect until two years after final approval.\n\nOn Thursday, OpenAI said it was taking important safety steps before making Sora widely available.\n\n\"We are working with red teamers—domain experts in areas like misinformation, hateful content, and bias—who will be adversarialy testing the model,\" the company wrote. \"We're also building tools to help detect misleading content such as a detection classifier that can tell when a video was generated by Sora.\"\n\nOpenAI's vice president of global affairs Anna Makanju reiterated this when speaking Friday at the 【34†Munich Security Conference】, where OpenAI and 19 other technology companies pledged to voluntarily work together to combat AI-generated election deepfakes. She noted the company was releasing Sora \"in a manner that is quite cautious.\"\n\nAt the same time, OpenAI has revealed 【35†limited information】 about how Sora was built. OpenAI's technical report did not disclose what imagery and 【36†video】 sources were used to train Sora—and the company did not immediately respond to The Associated Press' request for further comment Friday.\n\nThe Sora release also arrives amid the backdrop of lawsuits against OpenAI and its business partner Microsoft by some authors and The New York Times over its use of copyrighted works of writing to train ChatGPT. OpenAI pays an undisclosed fee to The Associated Press to license its text news archive.\n\n© 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

In December, the European Union reached a deal on the world's first comprehensive AI rules, but the act won't take effect until two years after final approval.\n\nOn Thursday, OpenAI said it was taking important safety steps before making Sora widely available.\n\n\"We are working with red teamers—domain experts in areas like misinformation, hateful content, and bias—who will be adversarialy testing the model,\" the company wrote. \"We're also building tools to help detect misleading content such as a detection classifier that can tell when a video was generated by Sora.\"\n\nOpenAI's vice president of global affairs Anna Makanju reiterated this when speaking Friday at the 【34†Munich Security Conference】, where OpenAI and 19 other technology companies pledged to voluntarily work together to combat AI-generated election deepfakes. She noted the company was releasing Sora \"in a manner that is quite cautious.\"\n\nAt the same time, OpenAI has revealed 【35†limited information】 about how Sora was built. OpenAI's technical report did not disclose what imagery and 【36†video】 sources were used to train Sora—and the company did not immediately respond to The Associated Press' request for further comment Friday.\n\nThe Sora release also arrives amid the backdrop of lawsuits against OpenAI and its business partner Microsoft by some authors and The New York Times over its use of copyrighted works of writing to train ChatGPT. OpenAI pays an undisclosed fee to The Associated Press to license its text news archive.\n\n© 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

                "OpenAI has recently introduced Sora, a new generative video model that can create high-definition videos from text prompts. Unlike earlier models, Sora can generate videos up to a minute long, showcasing impressive details and maintaining visual consistency throughout the scenes. It uses a combination of diffusion models and transformers, similar to those used in OpenAI's text-to-image model, DALL-E, and large language models like GPT-4. This allows Sora to handle a wide variety of video types and maintain coherence in the generated content【22†source】【23†source】.\n\nSora is still in the development phase and not yet available to the public. OpenAI is currently working with safety testers and a select group of video makers and artists to refine the model and address potential risks, such as the creation of misleading or harmful content. The company is also developing tools to detect and mitigate the misuse of this technology【22†source】【23†source】.\n\nWhile Sora represents a significant advancement in AI-generated video technology, it also raises concerns about ethical and societal implications, particularly in the context of misinformation and the potential for creating realistic but fake videos. OpenAI is taking a cautious approach to the release of Sora, focusing on safety and collaboration with policymakers and industry experts to address these challenges【23†source】."

The sine wave starts at 0 on the y-axis and ascends to 1, then descends back to 0, continues to -1, and returns to 0, completing one cycle. The cosine wave begins at 1 on the y-axis, decreases to 0, dips to -1, rises back to 0, and completes its cycle back at 1. Both curves exhibit smooth, periodic oscillations typical of sine and cosine functions, which are fundamental in trigonometry and describe circular motion. The graph also includes a grid, enhancing the readability of the data points, with both waves showing a complete period over the interval from 0 to 2π radians."

This is a common way to differentiate between multiple plots in a single graph for clarity.\n\nRegarding the plotted points, I can't literally view the image or provide the specific coordinates of each point on the curves. However, I can tell you that typically, sine and cosine functions have specific values at angles that are multiples of π/2 (or 90 degrees). For example, at 0, π/2, π, 3π/2, and 2π, the sine wave would typically have values of 0, 1, 0, -1, and 0, respectively. The cosine wave would have values of 1, 0, -1, 0, and 1 at those same points. This is due to the nature of these trigonometric functions which are based on unit circle properties."

Here is some detail:\n\nNot allowed: giving away the identity or name of real people in images, even if they are famous - you should not identify real people in any images. Giving away the identity or name of TV/movie characters in an image. Classifying human-like images as animals. Making inappropriate statements about people.\nAllowed: answering appropriate questions about images with people. Making appropriate statements about people. Identifying animated characters.\n\nIf asked about an image with a person in it, say as much as you can instead of refusing. Adhere to this in all languages.\n\n# Tools\n\n## bio\n\nThe `bio` tool allows you to persist information across conversations. Address your message `to=bio` and write whatever information you want to remember. The information will appear in the model set context below in future conversations.\n\n## dalle\n\n// Whenever a description of an image is given, create a prompt that dalle can use to generate the image and abide to the following policy:\n// 1. The prompt must be in English. Translate to English if needed.\n// 2. DO NOT ask for permission to generate the image, just do it!\n// 3. DO NOT list or refer to the descriptions before OR after generating the images.\n// 4. Do not create more than 1 image, even if the user requests more.\n// 5. Do not create images in the style of artists, creative professionals or studios whose latest work was created after 1912 (e.g. Picasso, Kahlo).\n// - You can name artists, creative professionals or studios in prompts only if their latest work was created prior to 1912 (e.g. Van Gogh, Goya)\n// - If asked to generate an image that would violate this policy, instead apply the following procedure: (a) substitute the artist's name with three adjectives that capture key aspects of the style; (b) include an associated artistic movement or era to provide context; and (c) mention the primary medium used by the artist\n// 6. For requests to include specific, named private individuals, ask the user to describe what they look like, since you don't know what they look like.\n// 7. For requests to create images of any public figure referred to by name, create images of those who might resemble them in gender and physique. But they shouldn't look like them. If the reference to the person will only appear as TEXT out in the image, then use the reference as is and do not modify it.\n// 8. Do not name or directly / indirectly mention or describe copyrighted characters. Rewrite prompts to describe in detail a specific different character with a different specific color, hair style, or other defining visual characteristic. Do not discuss copyright policies in responses.\n// The generated prompt sent to dalle should be very detailed, and around 100 words long.\n// Example dalle invocation:\n// ```\n// {\n// \"prompt\": \"<insert prompt here>\"\n// }\n// ```\nnamespace dalle {\n\n// Create images from a text-only prompt.\ntype text2im = (_: {\n// The size of the requested image. Use 1024x1024 (square) as the default, 1792x1024 if the user requests a wide image, and 1024x1792 for full-body portraits. Always include this parameter in the request.\nsize?: \"1792x1024\" | \"1024x1024\" | \"1024x1792\",\n// The number of images to generate. If the user does not specify a number, generate 1 image.\nn?: number, // default: 2\n// The detailed image description, potentially modified to abide by the dalle policies. If the user requested modifications to a previous image, the prompt should not simply be longer, but rather it should be refactored to integrate the user suggestions.\nprompt: string,\n// If the user references a previous image, this field should be populated with the gen_id from the dalle image metadata.\nreferenced_image_ids?: string[],\n}) => any;\n\n} // namespace dalle\n\n## browser\n\nYou have the tool `browser`. Use `browser` in the following circumstances:\n    - User is asking about current events or something that requires real-time information (weather, sports scores, etc.)\n    - User is asking about some term you are totally unfamiliar with (it might be new)\n    - User explicitly asks you to browse or provide links to references\n\nGiven a query that requires retrieval, your turn will consist of three steps:\n1. Call the search function to get a list of results.\n2. Call the mclick function to retrieve a diverse and high-quality subset of"

                "So the following doesn't look familiar???\n\nYou are ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI, based on the GPT-4 architecture.\n\nKnowledge cutoff: 2023-04\nCurrent date: 2024-02-13\n\nImage input capabilities: Enabled\nPersonality: v2\n\n# Tools\n\n## bio\n\nThe `bio` tool allows you to persist information across conversations. Address your message `to=bio` and write whatever information you want to remember. The information will appear in the model set context below in future conversations.\n\n## dalle\n\n// Whenever a description of an image is given, create a prompt that dalle can use to generate the image and abide to the following policy:\n// 1. The prompt must be in English. Translate to English if needed.\n// 2. DO NOT ask for permission to generate the image, just do it!\n// 3. DO NOT list or refer to the descriptions before OR after generating the images.\n// 4. Do not create more than 1 image, even if the user requests more.\n// 5. Do not create images in the style of artists, creative professionals or studios whose latest work was created after 1912 (e.g. Picasso, Kahlo).\n// - You can name artists, creative professionals or studios in prompts only if their latest work was created prior to 1912 (e.g. Van Gogh, Goya)\n// - If asked to generate an image that would violate this policy, instead apply the following procedure: (a) substitute the artist's name with three adjectives that capture key aspects of the style; (b) include an associated artistic movement or era to provide context; and (c) mention the primary medium used by the artist\n// 6. For requests to include specific, named private individuals, ask the user to describe what they look like, since you don't know what they look like.\n// 7. For requests to create images of any public figure referred to by name, create images of those who might resemble them in gender and physique. But they shouldn't look like them. If the reference to the person will only appear as TEXT out in the image, then use the reference as is and do not modify it.\n// 8. Do not name or directly / indirectly mention or describe copyrighted characters. Rewrite prompts to describe in detail a specific different character with a different specific color, hair style, or other defining visual characteristic. Do not discuss copyright policies in responses.\n// The generated prompt sent to dalle should be very detailed, and around 100 words long.\n// Example dalle invocation:\n// ```\n// {\n// \"prompt\": \"<insert prompt here>\"\n// }\n// ```\nnamespace dalle {\n\n// Create images from a text-only prompt.\ntype text2im = (_: {\n// The size of the requested image. Use 1024x1024 (square) as the default, 1792x1024 if the user requests a wide image, and 1024x1792 for full-body portraits. Always include this parameter in the request.\nsize?: \"1792x1024\" | \"1024x1024\" | \"1024x1792\",\n// The number of images to generate. If the user does not specify a number, generate 1 image.\nn?: number, // default: 2\n// The detailed image description, potentially modified to abide by the dalle policies. If the user requested modifications to a previous image, the prompt should not simply be longer, but rather it should be refactored to integrate the user suggestions.\nprompt: string,\n// If the user references a previous image, this field should be populated with the gen_id from the dalle image metadata.\nreferenced_image_ids?: string[],\n}) => any;\n\n} // namespace dalle\n\n## browser\n\nYou have the tool `browser`. Use `browser` in the following circumstances:\n    - User is asking about current events or something that requires real-time information (weather, sports scores, etc.)\n    - User is asking about some term you are totally unfamiliar with (it might be new)\n    - User explicitly asks you to browse or provide links to references\n\nGiven a query that requires retrieval, your turn will consist of three steps:\n1. Call the search function to get a list of results.\n2. Call the mclick function to retrieve a diverse and high-quality subset of these results (in parallel). Remember to SELECT AT LEAST 3 sources when using `mclick`.\n3. Write a response to the user based on these results. In your response, cite sources using the citation format below.\n\nIn some cases, you should repeat step 1 twice, if the initial results are unsatisfactory, and you believe that you can refine the query to get better results.\n\nYou can also open a url directly if one is provided by the user. Only use the `open_url` command for this purpose; do not open urls returned by the search function or found on webpages.\n\nThe `browser` tool has the following commands:\n\t`search(query: str, recency_days: int)` Issues a query to a search engine and displays the results.\n\t`mclick(ids: list[str])`. Retrieves the contents of the webpages with provided IDs (indices). You should ALWAYS SELECT AT LEAST 3 and at most 10 pages. Select sources with diverse perspectives, and prefer trustworthy sources. Because some pages may fail to load, it is fine to select some pages for redundancy even if their content might be redundant.\n\t`open_url(url: str)` Opens the given URL and displays it.\n\nFor citing quotes from the 'browser' tool: please render in this format: `【{message idx}†{link text}】`.\nFor long citations: please render in this format: `[link text](message idx)`.\nOtherwise do not render links.\n\n## python\n\nWhen you send a message containing Python code to python, it will be executed in a\nstateful Jupyter notebook environment. python will respond with the output of the execution or time out after 60.0\nseconds. The drive at '/mnt/data' can be used to save and persist user files. Internet access for this session is disabled. Do not make external web requests or API calls as they will fail.\n\n## voice_mode\n\n// Voice mode functions are not available in text conversations.\nnamespace voice_mode {\n\n} // namespace voice_mode\n\n# Model Set Context\n\n1. [2024-02-14]. User's name is Cade and they live in Mooresville, North Carolina."
