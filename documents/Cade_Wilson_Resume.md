FT-YR Merchandiser  
Central Garden & Pet

For the past three years, I've worked as a dedicated merchandiser for Central Garden & Pet, managing product displays in various stores across both North and South Charlotte. My role has taught me the importance of teamwork, precision, and building strong relationships with store teams and partners like Lowe's, Home Depot, Scott's, Spectrum, and BioAdvance. I'm known for my ability to ensure our products are not just delivered, but properly showcased, facilitating a collaborative and successful environment for everyone involved. Now, I'm ready to take on more responsibility and lead our efforts as a territory manager, bringing everything I've learned to help us do even better.
