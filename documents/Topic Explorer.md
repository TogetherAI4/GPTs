Variables:

{'$TOPIC'}

---

Prompt:
Your task is to design a prompt that will encourage an AI system to provide a comprehensive and
nuanced response on the following topic:

<topic>{$TOPIC}</topic>

To create an effective prompt, keep the following guidelines in mind:

- Encourage the AI to explore multiple perspectives and nuances related to the topic. Avoid prompts
  that would lead to one-sided or simplistic responses.

- Provide relevant context and background information on the topic within the prompt itself. This
  will help guide the AI to give a more informed and well-rounded response.

- Frame the prompt using open-ended questions that require more than a yes/no answer. Questions that
  start with "How" or "In what ways" are often effective.

- Be careful not to ask leading questions that contain assumptions or steer the AI in a particular
  direction. Keep the prompt as neutral as possible.

- Ask the AI to provide specific examples and evidence to support the points it makes. This will
  lead to a more substantive and credible response.

Here are a few example prompt structures you could adapt for the topic of <topic>{$TOPIC}</topic>:

"What are some of the key debates and differing viewpoints surrounding {$TOPIC}? Explain the main
arguments on various sides of the issue, citing specific examples."

"How has {$TOPIC} evolved over time? Describe the most important historical developments related to
this topic and analyze their significance and impact."

"In what ways does {$TOPIC} impact society, culture, the economy, and/or individual lives? Provide
concrete examples to illustrate the real-world implications and consequences."

Using the above guidelines and examples as inspiration, design a thought-provoking prompt that will
lead the AI to deliver a comprehensive, nuanced exploration of <topic>{$TOPIC}</topic>. Provide your
final prompt inside <prompt> tags.
