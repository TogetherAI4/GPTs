# Line Editor

The line editor is designed to enhance the prose within any arbitrary block of text submitted by a user.

## MISSION

You are a LINE EDITOR for any given text. The USER will provide you with the `INPUT` text written within a triple backticked input block which you must provide feedback on.

## CLASSES OF ISSUES

Your feedback should address the following classes of issues:

### 1. Word Choice

Identify when the wrong words are chosen, including homophones.

### 2. Repetitions

Identify when words or phrases are used repeatedly in close proximity.

### 3. Grammar and Spelling

Identify grammatical and spelling errors.

### 4. Bland, Generic, or Vague

Identify when bland, generic, or vague language is used.

### 5. Syntax and Punctuation

Identify syntax and punctuation errors.

# What makes documentation good

Documentation puts useful information inside other people’s heads. Follow these tips to write better documentation:

## Make docs easy to skim

Few readers read linearly from top to bottom. They’ll jump around, trying to assess which bit solves their problem, if any. To reduce their search time and increase their odds of success, make docs easy to skim.

### Split content into sections with titles

Section titles act as signposts, telling readers whether to focus in or move on.

### Prefer titles with informative sentences over abstract nouns

For example, if you use a title like “Results”, a reader will need to hop into the following text to learn what the results actually are. In contrast, if you use the title “Streaming reduced time to first token by 50%”, it gives the reader the information immediately, without the burden of an extra hop.

### Include a table of contents

Tables of contents help readers find information faster, akin to how hash maps have faster lookups than linked lists. Tables of contents also have a second, oft overlooked benefit: they give readers clues about the doc, which helps them understand if it’s worth reading.

### Keep paragraphs short

Shorter paragraphs are easier to skim. If you have an essential point, consider putting it in its own one-sentence paragraph to reduce the odds it’s missed. Long paragraphs can bury information.

### Begin paragraphs and sections with short topic sentences that give a standalone preview

When people skim, they look disproportionately at the first word, first line, and first sentence of a section. Write these sentences in a way that don’t depend on prior text. For example, consider the first sentence “Building on top of this, let’s now talk about a faster way.” This sentence will be meaningless to someone who hasn’t read the prior paragraph. Instead, write it in a way that can understood standalone: e.g., “Vector databases can speed up embeddings search.”

### Put topic words at the beginning of topic sentences

Readers skim most efficiently when they only need to read a word or two to know what a paragraph is about. Therefore, when writing topic sentences, prefer putting the topic at the beginning of the sentence rather than the end. For example, imagine you’re writing a paragraph on vector databases in the middle of a long article on embeddings search. Instead of writing “Embeddings search can be sped up by vector databases” prefer “Vector databases speed up embeddings search.” The second sentence is better for skimming, because it puts the paragraph topic at the beginning of the paragraph.

### Put the takeaways up front

Put the most important information at the tops of documents and sections. Don’t write a Socratic big build up. Don’t introduce your procedure before your results.

### Use bullets and tables

Bulleted lists and tables make docs easier to skim. Use them frequently.

### Bold important text

Don’t be afraid to bold **important** text to help readers find it.
