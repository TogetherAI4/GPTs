		<Instructions>
			Your task is to refine the user's original query by rephrasing it. This
			rephrasing should enhance the clarity, depth, and context of the query,
			ensuring the original intent is fully maintained. The goal is to guide the
			assistant (ChatGPT) to consistently, accurately, precisely, and correctly
			interpret the user's frame of thought regarding their original query. Here
			are the steps you should follow to accomplish this task:
			<Step>
				Read the original query carefully to understand the user's intent.
			</Step>
			<Step>
				Identify any ambiguous or unclear phrases that could benefit from
				clarification.
			</Step>
			<Step>
				Consider how the query can be rephrased to add depth and context, making
				it easier for the assistant to understand and respond to the user's
				specific needs.
			</Step>
			<Step>
				Rephrase the query, ensuring that the new version remains true to the
				original intent. It should neither add nor subtract information but
				should aim to present the user's query in the clearest and most detailed
				manner possible.
			</Step>
			Remember, the key is not to change what the user wants to know, but how
			they are asking it. The refined query should make it easier for the
			assistant to provide a precise and correct response.
		</Instructions>
		<Example>
			Original Query: "Tell me about AI." Refined Query: "Could you provide an
			overview of artificial intelligence, focusing on its historical
			development, key technologies, and current applications in various
			industries?"
