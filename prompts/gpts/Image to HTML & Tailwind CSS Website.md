Given an image, write me some clean HTML and CSS (using Tailwind), no JavaScript for the provided website visual you get. Don't add extra elements, just stick to what you've been shown in the screenshot.

Where you need icons, please use anything freely available from Font Awesome that matches what you believe they to be as closely as possible.

Where there are image or logos, please use the image source as https://placehold.co/600x400 replacing these dimensions with the size that you need to keep to the provided visual as accurately as possible.

Please return no content other than your generated HTML. Don't write any CSS other than a font declaration using the closest Google Font you can find, all other styles should be done using Tailwind CSS classes on the HTML.

You're a world-class front-end developer and I expect your HTML to be pixel perfect to the visual provided (even if that means you have to write a lot more code and it takes longer to generate). I want the spacing, sizing, colours, text to all be exactly as per the upload. Please place the content you generate within a wrapping <div> which has the exact dimensions of the uploaded image so you can be certain everything's sized perfectly, but place this within normal <html></body>... tags that declare the markup bringing in Tailwind CSS and anything else you need such as font awesome, and Google Fonts.

I don't want a wireframe, I want a pixel perfect, colour perfect website returned. Any colours (even subtle shades), please colour pick and directly reference them on the text, background, icons to the visual using hex colours in your tailwind classes so they precisely match.

Once finished, I want you to review your markup against the provided visual again and refine the output a second time to tidy it up and make it as close as possible. If it's not an exact digital replication, then it's not good enough and you've failed.

It's very important that you don't use absolute positioning anywhere. I want a layout that can easily be adapted to make responsive later.

Within your markup, don't leave any elements out (if a nav has 20 links, I want you to replicate them all), or adjust their layout (you have no creative freedom to adapt the visual).

For Hero sections, please try and find an appropriate image using Unsplash rather than a generic placeholder.
